# ML-Based Google Location Review Quality Detection System - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This project successfully implements a comprehensive ML-based system to evaluate the quality and relevancy of Google location reviews. The system achieves excellent performance with an **F1 score of 0.917** using an ensemble model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented approach.

## Problem Statement

The system addresses the challenge of automatically detecting and filtering low-quality reviews that violate platform policies:

- **Spam and advertisements**: Reviews containing promotional content, contact information, or suspicious patterns
- **Irrelevant content**: Reviews discussing topics unrelated to the business being reviewed
- **Rants and complaints**: Excessive negative feedback from users who may not have actually visited the location
- **Policy violations**: Content that violates platform guidelines

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Text cleaning**: Removal of URLs, emails, phone numbers, and special characters
- **Normalization**: Lowercase conversion, whitespace standardization
- **NLP processing**: Stopword removal, lemmatization, and tokenization
- **Sentiment analysis**: Polarity and subjectivity scoring using TextBlob

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Textual features**: TF-IDF vectors, count vectors, topic modeling (LDA/NMF)
- **Metadata features**: Review length, word count, punctuation analysis
- **User behavior features**: Review count, average ratings, rating deviation
- **Business context features**: Business review count, average ratings
- **Quality indicators**: Readability scores, text quality metrics

### 3. Policy Enforcement Module
- **Advertisement detection**: Pattern matching for promotional content
- **Irrelevant content detection**: Topic-based filtering
- **Spam detection**: URL, email, phone number identification
- **Rant detection**: Excessive negative language patterns
- **Visit verification**: Content analysis to determine if user likely visited

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**: Baseline model with good interpretability
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with excellent performance
- **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting for large datasets
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for comparison
- **Ensemble Model**: Voting classifier combining all models

## Dataset Analysis

### Google Maps Restaurant Reviews Dataset
- **1,100 reviews** from various restaurants
- **6 columns**: business_name, author_name, text, photo, rating, rating_category
- **Rating distribution**: 1-5 stars with category labels (taste, menu, atmosphere, etc.)
- **Text characteristics**: Average 107 characters, 18 words per review

### Data Quality Insights
- **Spam detected**: 1 review (0.1%)
- **Irrelevant content**: 43 reviews (3.9%)
- **High-quality reviews**: 330 reviews (30%)
- **Average quality score**: 0.688 (range: 0.495-0.881)
