# Review Quality Detection System - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This project implements a **corrected** machine learning system for detecting review quality based purely on text characteristics and policy compliance, **without using rating data**. The system achieves excellent performance with an **F1 score of 0.986** using an ensemble model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the corrected approach.

## Problem Statement & Correction

### Original Problem
The initial system incorrectly used **rating data** (1-5 stars for restaurant satisfaction) to determine **review quality**, which is fundamentally wrong because:
- Rating = User satisfaction with the restaurant
- Review Quality = How well-written, informative, and policy-compliant the review text is

### The Correction
The system was completely redesigned to focus purely on **review text quality** and **policy compliance**, completely removing rating-based features from quality assessment.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Text cleaning**: Removal of URLs, emails, phone numbers, and special characters
- **Normalization**: Lowercase conversion, whitespace standardization
- **NLP processing**: Stopword removal, lemmatization, and tokenization
- **Sentiment analysis**: Polarity and subjectivity scoring using TextBlob

### 2. Feature Engineering (NO RATING DATA)
- **Textual features**: TF-IDF vectors, count vectors, topic modeling (LDA/NMF)
- **Text quality features**: Review length, word count, punctuation analysis, readability scores
- **Policy violation features**: Spam detection, advertisement detection, irrelevant content detection
- **Writing sophistication**: Vocabulary diversity, grammar indicators, formatting analysis

### 3. Policy Enforcement Module
- **Advertisement detection**: Pattern matching for promotional content ("buy now", "special offer", etc.)
- **Spam detection**: URL, email, phone number identification, suspicious patterns
- **Irrelevant content detection**: Politics, sports, weather, entertainment topics
- **Rant detection**: Excessive negative language patterns, repetitive complaints
- **Quality standards**: Minimum length, excessive formatting, low vocabulary

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**: Baseline model with good interpretability
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with excellent performance
- **Ensemble Model**: Voting classifier combining all models

## Dataset Analysis

### Google Maps Restaurant Reviews Dataset
- **1,100 reviews** from various restaurants
- **6 columns**: business_name, author_name, text, photo, rating, rating_category
- **Rating distribution**: 1-5 stars (used for context only, NOT for quality scoring)
- **Text characteristics**: Average 107 characters, 18 words per review

### Data Quality Insights
- **Spam detected**: 1 review (0.1%)
- **Irrelevant content**: 43 reviews (3.9%)
- **High-quality reviews**: 280 reviews (25.5%)
- **Policy violations**: 35 reviews requiring review/rejection

## Model Performance Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC | PR AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Ensemble** | **0.986** | **0.986** | **0.986** | **0.986** | **0.999** | **0.999** |
| XGBoost | 0.973 | 0.973 | 0.973 | 0.973 | 0.996 | 0.994 |
| Random Forest | 0.886 | 0.889 | 0.886 | 0.885 | 0.958 | 0.948 |

### Key Performance Highlights
- **Ensemble model achieves the best performance** across all metrics
- **High ROC AUC (0.999)** indicates excellent discrimination ability
- **Balanced precision and recall** (0.986 each) shows no bias toward either class
- **Strong performance on imbalanced dataset** (25.5% positive class)

## Policy Enforcement Results

### Review Classification
- **Approved**: 833 reviews (75.7%) - No policy violations
- **Approved with warning**: 232 reviews (21.1%) - Minor violations
- **Under review**: 34 reviews (3.1%) - Medium-severity violations
- **Rejected**: 1 review (0.1%) - Critical violations

### Policy Violation Types Detected
- **Advertisements**: Promotional content, sales pitches, contact information
- **Spam**: Phone numbers, emails, URLs, suspicious patterns
- **Irrelevant content**: Politics, sports, weather, entertainment
- **Excessive rants**: Overly negative, repetitive complaints
- **Poor formatting**: Excessive caps, punctuation, low quality

## Feature Importance Analysis

### Top Quality Indicators (NO RATING DATA)
1. **Text quality score** - Overall text quality assessment
2. **Readability score** - Text complexity and comprehension
3. **Policy compliance** - Absence of violations
4. **Vocabulary diversity** - Unique word ratio
5. **Writing sophistication** - Grammar and formatting quality

### Key Insight: Rating vs Quality Independence
The system demonstrates that:
- **High rating (5 stars) can have low quality** (spam, ads, irrelevant content)
- **Low rating (1 star) can have high quality** (well-written, constructive criticism)
- **Quality and rating are completely independent concepts**

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.13** with comprehensive ML libraries
- **Scikit-learn**: Classical ML algorithms
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting framework
- **NLTK & TextBlob**: Natural language processing
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Corrected System Design**
- ✅ Removed all rating-based features from quality assessment
- ✅ Focused purely on text quality and policy compliance
- ✅ Implemented proper content moderation policies

### 2. **Excellent Performance**
- ✅ 98.6% accuracy with ensemble model
- ✅ Balanced precision and recall
- ✅ High ROC AUC (0.999) indicating excellent discrimination

### 3. **Comprehensive Policy Enforcement**
- ✅ Advertisement detection
- ✅ Spam detection
- ✅ Irrelevant content filtering
- ✅ Rant detection
- ✅ Quality standards enforcement

### 4. **Clear Separation of Concepts**
- ✅ Rating = User satisfaction (separate from quality)
- ✅ Quality = Text characteristics and policy compliance
- ✅ Independent assessment of each concept

## Conclusion

This project successfully implements a **corrected review quality detection system** that properly separates user satisfaction (rating) from review quality. The system achieves excellent performance by focusing on:

1. **Text quality characteristics** (length, readability, vocabulary)
2. **Policy compliance** (no ads, spam, irrelevant content, rants)
3. **Writing sophistication** (grammar, formatting, style)

The corrected system maintains platform integrity by ensuring reviews are judged on their actual quality and appropriateness, not on user satisfaction with the restaurant experience.

**Key Innovation**: The system demonstrates that review quality and restaurant rating are completely independent concepts, requiring separate assessment methodologies
