Fish & Co.,sam Tan,"Huge disappointment today, as a customer who have been visting the restaurant since 2018, me and my friends always had enjoyed our meals and time at this restaurant. Until today, when I visitted again with my friend for dinner is our WORST eating experience by far.

It all started when we were waiting to be served, we avoided peak hours at around 4:30PM and though there were almost no customer in the restaurant, the staffs were chatting around and no one came to serve though I believe a few of them saw us. It was only until we signalled when one came over. This was still alright for us but already a bad impression. Can tell that the standards have really dropped.

Next we had our meal as per normal, UNTIL when we were about to finish. One of the staff - FAZIL, took the utensils holder straight, took the receipt which was in there and threw it disrespectfully straight at the table. We were stunned and of course unhappy by such action. If he wanted to take the utensils holder, I thought it was a basic courtesy to ask, not only did he not, he threw the receipt straight. What's worst was there were no customers even queing to be served, don't understand why it was so urgent that he had to act as such? I get much better service and respect at hawker centre and coffee shops and I DO NOT even need to pay service charges. I am paying service charges for such service WOW. And guess what? That is not it, he later came back again and took away my glass when my drink was still HALF FILLED. We may have finished our food but does that mean we won't want our drinks anymore? Hello? We paid for the drinks too!

Seems like only prices increase while service decreased SO MUCH. Congrats! You have just lost yourself a group of loyal customers who visit on a constant basis. We may or may not be the first who was dissapointed by such service but if it does not improve and if FAZIL is still serving, there would only be more.

Doesn’t help that flies are constantly flying around and eating the stuff before you do. Items that are fried are overly oily and soaking in oil. Middle aged woman was also unhygienic. Saw her licking her bare finger as she was pouring the chili and continue with her affairs handling other food.

No wonder the other new Yong Tau Fu stall with no google maps presence has more people patronizing.

COLLIN'S® Mandai Wildlife West,Kelly Yu,"Very Disappointed with this Collin’s Branch – Poor Service & Food Quality

Visited this outlet with high expectations, especially given its location in a popular tourist area. Unfortunately, the experience was extremely disappointing.

The customer service was appalling. Staff were unfriendly, impatient, and clearly not service-oriented. One male server with a tattoo on his left hand was particularly rude, responding in an unprofessional tone and showing no effort to be welcoming. Most of the team lacked basic hospitality standards — no smiles, no eye contact, and an overall unwillingness to assist.

The food quality was also below standard. We were served burnt meat (see attached photo), which was unacceptable.

Despite the restaurant being nearly empty around 3:30pm (off-peak hour), we (3pax) were forced to sit in a tight corner with a baby chair squeezed to the side.  According to the server, the table that we pointed pointed to him is for table of 6 in a very unfriendly tone, Meanwhile, staff were on break at the bar counter, watching videos on their phones with the volume turned up, further diminishing the dining atmosphere.

For a brand like Collin’s, especially in a tourist-frequented area, this is unacceptable. I sincerely hope the management looks into this and takes appropriate action to improve both service standards and food quality.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/COLLIN'S%C2%AE+Mandai+Wildlife+West/@1.4344838,103.7434359,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da139e09e38d6f:0xb24083ed1d355288!8m2!3d1.4087805!4d103.7801995!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESd2VzdGVybl9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5zTlVwSFQzVlJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECBIQTA!16s%2Fg%2F11sskydtfy"

81 Seafood Restaurant,Elsan Chow,"Bad review

This was my second visit and unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment as compared to the first patronage which was a pleasant experience for my family and I.

I booked a KTV room cum dinner for 26 Aug at 6:45pm on 4 Aug at 11:34am and got a WhatsApp confirmation for my booking.

However to our horror, when we turned up on the actual day, we were informed there’s no KTV and table reserved and they can only provide 2 small tables for 11pax at that point of time. This dinner was suppose to celebrate my mother’s birthday so we refused to settle for 2 separate tables.

They finally managed to squeeze a big table for us after some debating but sadly, no KTV as there were other diners occupying the ‘room’ meant for KTV.

As some of my family members are on special diet, we had to order separate share of Hor Fun, Bee Hoon etc for them on top of some other dishes meant for sharing.

After serving most of the main shared dishes (a good 30-45min), one of the Hor Fun we ordered was still not served. We had to keep asking and chasing before the food finally came. This was really unacceptable - cooking a plate of Hor Fun should not take more than 15min if you ask me.

The next issue we had was the portion for ‘large’ was miserable. We all thought it was a ‘small’ portion until we make payment and was surprised to know it was suppose to be ‘large’. The portion was so small that even a small eater like my dad also complained he didn’t have enough - that’s how bad it was.

To conclude, this will be the second and last time we dine at 81 restaurant.

A restaurant that does not honour reservation DO NOT deserve our patronage and this is one of the worst restaurant we visited so far.

NOMADS,Daniel,"Great ambience, a café with a cool outdoor camping vibe that’s Instagram worthy.

But food? Honestly, skip the truffle fries. Paid $18 expecting truffle goodness, but all I got was plain fries with zero truffle flavor. Is truffle oil really that expensive, or are they just being stingy?

Ordered the tiger prawn aglio olio for $28, and it tasted like something you’d get at Saizeriya. The only saving grace was the size of the prawn, but it wasn’t even fresh.

Also, a heads up, the high ratings here might be because they waive your drinks if you leave a Google review but only if it’s 4 stars or above. Now you know why the reviews look so good.

And about the service charge you’re paying, what exactly does it cover? Just bringing you the food, which McDonald’s does for free. Not even a free glass of water refill for the prices they charge.

Odette,Raphael Revindran,"Quite possibly the worst dining experience I've ever had. From the lukewarm reception to the lacklustre courses, one struggles to find the slightest semblance of a redeeming quality for this ""priceless jewel"", as dubbed by the powers that be behind the Michelin guide.

In fact, its presence on the roster calls all other entries into contention, notwithstanding that our visits elsewhere were delightful, and this being the chief (and sole) offender.

There are many outfits which are pretentious, but they at least have the decency to match their air of superiority with an impressive gastronomic experience.

Odette was neither.

(1) Service & Ambience
We were seated in the main dining hall. If you prefer a modicum of privacy while you try to make justifications for this sorry excuse of a meal, well, unfortunately, you would be fresh out of luck.

When we were not making awkward eye contact with patrons seated across from us, we were treated to an incessant, unrefined flurry of staff who simply could not remain out of sight. To top it off, we had the great fortune to be seated where the entire kitchen could gawk at us throughout the meal while the “open kitchen” barely provided vision of kitchen activity.

The entire atmosphere was distracting, intrusive and highly uncomfortable.

(2) Presentation
Plating was boring, the very limited finesse present was contrived, and there was a severe lack of performative entrances.

(3) Culinary
- Grignotages: Flavours were very muted. Nothing spectacular.
- Mushroom “Tea” and Brioche: Appetising and earthy. Quite possibly the best dish Odette has to offer.
- Normandy Brown Crab: A complete blank. Zero flavour and there was hardly any crab.
- Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg: Laughable. For all its fanfare, it tasted barely a notch above a soft-boiled egg made at home.
- Langoustine ‘Comme un Dumpling’: Supplement $98, but hold the flavour. Truffles were either not properly stored or of a low quality, as they had no aroma at all. Langoustine was tasteless.
- Seaweed Butter Poached Scallop: Decent presentation and flavours, but I am being generous here. Very forgettable.
- Aveyron Lamb Saddle: A very sad lamb dish. The texture was completely off (tough, wrong mouthfeel), and its flavour was overly gamey with no depth.
- ‘Ispahan’ Vacherin: A tribute to… sad ice cream and sickeningly sweet artificial rose syrup? When I thought it could not get any worse, the server cleared our relatively untouched plates without bothering to ask how we found the dish. Come on.
- Douceurs: Looked sad, and tasted like it looked. Canelés were way too hard with barely any flavour, and seriously, cut fruits? Regardless of provenance, such a selection betrays laziness and incompetence.

(4) Value
No uni. No caviar. No foie gras. No high quality ingredients. Did I just pay a premium to be ogled at while I eat unimpressive and unimaginative food?

I am in no way saying those are obligatory inclusions, but when you can offer nothing else, at least soften the blow.

They say “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. Well, at Odette, the price is a four-figure sum, and the value is an inside joke ""at least it's better than Odette"", that I can make reference to every single time I have a substandard meal.

Pathetic.

##

I will not even deign to discuss elements such as complexity and synergy, as the individual flavours (or lack thereof) were either too muted or completely missed the mark.

In summary, dining at Odette was a lesson in mediocrity.

The food did not even taste bad, which makes it worse – because what that means is, it's not that Odette isn't trying, or that the crew has no formal training. Odette is pulling out all the stops, only to arrive at this utterly forgettable and pedestrian experience.

Toast Box (West Coast Plaza),Rachel LIM,"Extremely disappointed with the food quality at the West Coast Plaza Toast Box outlet. The soft-boiled eggs were completely overcooked – the yolks were half-solidified, and the whites were rubbery and clumpy, far from the smooth, silky texture you’d expect from a proper soft-boiled egg. As seen in the photo, the eggs looked unappetizing and poorly prepared, almost as if they were just left in hot water without any timing or care.

For a place known for local breakfast classics, this kind of inconsistency is frustrating. It’s not hard to get eggs right, especially when they’re a staple menu item. When even the basics are mishandled, it raises serious concerns about kitchen standards and staff training.

HaveFun Karaoke & Bistro (Thomson Plaza),hew yensim,"Extremely Poor Staff Experience – Disappointed Visit

Visited on 10 May 2025, around 9:40 PM, and unfortunately had one of the worst service experiences I’ve had at a HaveFun outlet.

We were sold a package that included snacks. Since we had just come from dinner, we were told by staff that we could order the food later — only to be told later that the kitchen was closed. No one warned us or reminded us. When we asked, the staff simply said “no can do” with no apology and no attempt to help. And the lady kept trying her everyway to stop her other staff from helping us.
Eventually, we were handed two cans of Sprite as compensation for something of higher value.

It wasn’t just a small mistake — it was poor communication, dismissive attitude, and zero ownership. Among all the branches I’ve visited, this particular team felt the most unprofessional and detached.

Hope management takes this seriously. It was meant to be a family evening, and we left feeling ignored and frustrated",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/HaveFun+Karaoke+%26+Bistro+(Thomson+Plaza)/@1.354879,103.7948151,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da10ea9a5835bb:0x712b4b2e3ab4ade2!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m5!1s0x31da1702374bdead:0x982e6d4ae6195ed4!8m2!3d1.3548791!4d103.8308643!16s%2Fg%2F11p3l2kyqz"

Hong Kong Kitchen,Terence Lee,"Food is decent, but service is very very very bad.

This is the worst service i have ever encountered in a restaurant in Singapore.

iPad order interface is difficult to understand, but staff was very reluctant to assist.

Staff threw the iPad back onto my table and rolled her eyes when I told her that I wasn’t done ordering after her initial assistance.

Wanted to order some drinks, but staff said just go get it myself from the fridge as that’s what everyone is doing.

Sought assistance from another staff (total of 2 attending to customers as the rest are all cooking in the kitchen) but was rudely instructed to refer to the other staff for help.

Ordered skewers but the amount was short of what we asked for (8 came instead of 10).  Although they did top it up for us it makes me wonder how they got it wrong as it was not even a massive order.

Towards the end of our dinner, heard the first staff chasing 2 tables of customers away the moment they finished their food as there were others waiting to eat.  Although it is understandable that customers should not linger during peak hours, the tone and attitude was really undesirable.

We told the staff that we couldn’t have possibly ordered the dishes, the timestamp says 740pm and we were only seated 755, how could we possibly have ordered those dishes. He explained that if it’s in the order it means we ordered it, so we told him again and he cancelled the whole order 20mins after we had initially ordered, inclusive of the previous set of dishes and the current set of dishes we had ordered, so we had to re-order everything 25mins later for no reason.

Have to say, despite the nice and new decor, convenient iPad ordering system, open kitchen concept, the dining experience has really declined. The food was alright, edible but nothing to scream about. The service was disappointing, as I was seated at a really tiny table that could not accommodate the dishes I ordered. It was such a tight fit that despite me requesting nicely to move to a larger empty table, no one wanted to assist me in that. The rationale being reserved or meant for 4 was thrown my way.

And when we loaded our orders, the waiter delivered us a list that had everybody’s order on it including my chicken rice but did not tell me chicken rice is sold out. I only found out because I asked for the status of my order. This restaurant failed on such a fundamental level.

Rice tasted like the cheapest quality, sayur lodeh tasted slightly sour & the chicken wing, was so dry and deader than dead- was so tough that the metal fork & spoon could not pierce or cut the meat easily.  The only saving grace was the quail egg with petai, although the petai was a bit anaemic and not fresh green.

Morsels Restaurant & Gastro Wine Bar | Morsels Private Dining,Shokoofeh Shafiei,"My visit to this restaurant was deeply disappointing. The moment I walked in, I noticed how unclean the place was, which set the tone for the rest of the experience. The entire atmosphere was moody and unpleasant, and it felt like the establishment hadn’t been maintained in years.

To make matters worse, there was only one washroom available which was behind a curtain(!), and it was in horrible condition—dark, dirty, and clearly outdated. It was honestly shocking to see a restaurant neglect such basic hygiene.

The food was equally bad, lacking quality, and the drink selection was abysmal. They didn’t even have enough inventory to support their menu, with just a few half-empty bottles on hand. It was clear they weren’t prepared to serve their customers properly.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are far better options out there that value cleanliness, quality, and service.

Anandham Chettinad Restaurant,MAI,"As you can refer to the order receipt of the dishes, this is a takeaway order. I personally ordered at the eatery yesterday (while braving with a heavy wet weather hoping to have a good meal) here comes my review.  The prawn briyani, a total disappointment in terms of taste. The prawns are not fresh at all so its a very stale taste while eating and basmati rice is overcooked.  Being a briyani lover I have tasted briyani in many shops around Singapore, from regular hawkers, to authentic Indian Muslim briyanis and also even established restaurants and this is one of the poorly prepared Briyani and Tandoori Briyani is also tasteless.

As for the fish curry. The eatery uses Ikan Tenggiri (local Malay word) also known as Spanish mackerels and I ask for the tail portion. The fish has a mushy texture when break into pieces to eat and tastes sour. Likely the fish maybe going bad soon. Fish curry is a very basic dish for any non-vegetarian Indian eateries, a base curry to use for rice, pratas and etc and even the Fish curry in this shop cannot even make it to 1 star. If the dishes are superb, spending more money for good food is worth it and I strongly believe its okay to pay for good food. This is a overly priced neighbourhood shop at Bukit Batok for a badly cooked briyani and curry fish.  Even didn't provide poppadoms for briyani. I think the only item that taste nice is the Raita (cucumber, carrot and green chillies with yogurt). Being a local Indian, I know how authentic Indian dishes should taste. Compared to smaller eateries at Little India or even in at hawker stalls, I have tasted better Indian cuisine.  This shop seriously has to polish up their culinary skills.

Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata in Singapore,Ng Jackaroo,"**Rating: ★☆☆☆☆**

We recently visited Siam Square Mookata and were extremely disappointed with the service. The grill we were given was clearly not hot enough, making it impossible to cook our meat properly. When we raised the issue with the uncle managing the place, he simply brushed us off, saying that the heat was sufficient and there was nothing he could do about it.

Despite our feedback, he didn't offer any assistance or solution, leaving us struggling to cook our food.

Nalan Restaurant Little India,amruta gurav,"Absolutely Awful Experience at Nalan, Singapore – Never Going Back

I took my family to Nalan for dinner, and it turned out to be a huge mistake. The service was absolutely pathetic. We ordered a simple tomato soup and veg fried rice. The soup took 15-20 minutes to arrive, which was fine — but after that, it felt like they completely forgot our table.

The waiter cleared the soup bowls but gave only two plates for a table of three. I had to ask again just to get one more plate for my father — basic common sense seemed completely absent.

Then came the worst part — we waited an entire hour for the veg fried rice. Tables that arrived after us were being served, while we kept waiting. We asked the staff politely about our order, and all we got was a robotic “it’s coming.” Another 30 minutes passed, and still nothing. We finally lost our patience, paid for the soup, and left — hungry and frustrated. Not a single apology from the staff for the insane delay.

To top it all off, the prices are ridiculously expensive for the kind of service and average food they offer. Absolutely zero value for money. This place does not care about customer experience.

If you’re looking for a peaceful dinner with decent service, stay far away from Nalan.

Atout,Jascha Ortmanns,"Unfortunately a very disappointing experience for a restaurant that used to be good.
Service quality is low - staff lack attention and speed. Long wait time until we could actually place an order.
During the meal new plates for mains were put on the table while we were still eating our starters. Not acceptable for a restaurant that wants to be high class and price.
Food quality disappointing - cassoulet was covered in a thick layer of bread crumbs and everything tasted of those.
Roast garlic chicken was certainly not toasted but came in a clay pot.
The real issue was that next to an $8 bread basket you get charged 2$ for butter and then again $2 for 2mm of olive oil in a 6x6cm dish. That is a first for Singapore.
Maybe lucky we did not get charged extra for the mediocre and very acidic balsamic vinegar….

Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,Harry Rettop,"Absolute rubbish of a place. Worst mookata place. Burner is stupid slow, so I asked for a gas change but dude showed me some casino sleight of gas burner hand. Plate remained not hot. Food quality is terrible, the beef shabu smells off like left for days. It has some strange aftertaste and even if just cooked a little it bricked up. The pork liver is really bad, I don’t know how to describe this. It’s hard and tasteless and comes in too many small pieces, lots to flip. The veggie platter has really unfresh vegetables and the corn comes scattered onto the basket like salt bae was back in the kitchen. And the bowl just couldn’t hold that much and the corn would roll off anytime so I had to pour them over the hot plate and chopstick them into the gutters. Honestly the experience is really bad I hate it. I wonder if anybody actually ate and run over here. The only saving grace is the mama noodle which we have at least some control of. If I could write a hundred review of this mookata outlet I would. This place needs to stop giving such bad food and service. Also their sauces looked fermented in their bin.

Service was great, the staff took the time to explain the dishes and how to eat them, and they were attentive enough throughout the meal.

All in all, I had an okay dinner at Ah Hua Kelong. Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend it as a must visit? Definitely not.

elemen 元素,MY,"Both service and food were subpar, I wouldn’t pay such prices to come again.

We ordered 2 8-course set and 1 Christmas set. Do note that you won’t be able to change any dish in the Christmas course meal. Each course was served super fast, we didn’t even have time to finish before the next one was served, so it got to a point where the table was filled with appetisers, soup and mains. Some servers would practically dump the plate on our table loudly and walk away like we owe them?

Moving on to the taste, the fruit rojak, sesame tofu, and unagi roll with tofu were not bad. Everything else tasted pretty average. Some of my friends found it weird that the appetisers and soup are sweet. We were looking forward to the desserts since they looked really pretty from the photos, but they tasted like store bought frozen 711 products. They didn’t even properly defrost them before serving.

The restaurant closes at 3.30, and they really chased all of us out on the dot. As such, we were scrambling to finish our food. Have been to other restaurants that closes in the afternoon before, and they all allowed guests to stay on in the restaurant, just that there would be no ordering/serving/billing after the stipulated closing time.

Mott 32 Singapore,Jolene Shen,"Heard great reviews about Mott32 and decided to head there with a couple of friends to celebrate their promotion.
Atmosphere was good, nicely dimmed, music playing softly in the background. We pre ordered their signature Peking duck, roast pork and char siew and also ordered black pepper beef, vermicelli with crab hot spicy Xiao long BAO.
Among all the dishes we ordered, the only one that wowed us was the roast pork. Extra crispy skin and tender pork meat.
Their signature duck and charsiew was underwhelming despite the price point. Duck meat was a tad dry and charsiew, while tender, didn't blow us away.
The good part of the M9 beef that we order was the black pepper sauce, the mushrooms and the asparagus. Everything but the beef. Beef was a bit tough though edible.
Last to serve was the vermicelli.... It was very bland, there's no 鲜味 to the dish and crab meat were dried up in the pot.
My friends and I agreed that at least we tried this place once and we know we won't be visiting again.
2 stars were for the nice atmosphere and cocktails.

Food is a huge disappointment. I expected more out of the sauce. Don't get me wrong, perhaps that's how the locals there eat.

Canopy Jurong Lake Gardens,MH Tham,"Think of this as a lite version of Canopy at HortPark, with fewer menu options, a much smaller alfresco area, and little shelter from the elements.

The location is far from ideal. The nearest car park is perpetually full on weekends and public holidays, forcing you to battle aggressive drivers for a spot or settle for a multi-storey HDB car park at least ten minutes away, where available lots start from level five.

Visually, the café is striking, blending modern aesthetics amidst the surrounding Chinese architecture. Its elevated position makes it pleasantly windy, a point to note for pet owners who are limited to the tiny alfresco area despite the spacious indoor seating.

Service is hit-or-miss, depending on the staff. We were initially welcomed by an attentive gentleman who did his best to seat us comfortably, even with a faulty overhead fan. However, the experience quickly unraveled when a female server repeatedly mixed up orders between tables, offered no explanation, and walked off awkwardly, leaving us confused.

The menu is uninspiring, with better options limited to brunch dishes or deep-fried staples like fish and chips. While portions are reasonable for the price, the food tasted disappointingly frozen rather than fresh.

The ART (Assumption Restaurant for Training),Lau Belle Lifeng,"Really wanted to like this place as the restaurant was set in such a beautiful environment on top of a hill with lovely surroundings in a school. But the food really needed more attention. Ordered the fish and chips set. Granted that it was a steal that at $16.50, there was mushroom soup and bread, main course, dessert and a hot tea. The breadroll was nice, but the soup has more flour than mushroom. The main was beautifully presented and I was really happy to dive into the food. But The fish was undercooked and batter was still wet and slimy inside, the chips was hard and not crispy. Feels almost that the the food was cooked at too low a temperature. The side salad that came with it was a really weird tasting dressing like a mushroom vinaigrette gone wrong.
Lastly the dessert consisting of a cube of marble cake and brownie with ice cream tasted floury and dry.
Kudos that the staff re cooked a new fish and chips for me. But it still tasted off with the fish too oily and still slimy and the chips still hard not and crispy.
Hope the kitchen will see  this review positively and make some improvements.

Shan Cheng (Ipoh Delicacies) ● 山城 - Bukit Panjang Plaza,M S,"We wanted to try Ipoh Hor Fun and this seems to be the only option around Bukit Panjang. We ordered 3 different styles of Hor Fun and Noodles for a broader perspective of this restaurant. Our collective conclusion is this restaurant is not worth the visit until improvements are made. The Hor Fun Soup tasted bland and diluted. The Hor Fun Dry comes with a separate bowl of soup and that is also diluted. For relative comparison, the noodle dishes here are average food court standard but at a premium price. As for the service, I'd expect a restaurant (this is not a food court) selling at a higher price to offer better customer service. As we walked in and asked for a table, the staff directed us backward to the entrance pointing to a pile of menus and telling us to come back to the counter for our order. No, they're not rude, just want to point out this is not a service-oriented restaurant. They could have continued with the flow to have us seated, brought along the menus, and then explained their ordering process. There were 4 staff total and we were the only table on a Monday at 5pm! No excuse for being too busy for better customer service. Food is ordered in person over the counter, paid on the spot (credit card accepted) and a device is provided that will buzz when our order is ready for pickup.

Lolla,Merfy G.,"Definitely not worth the price The service and the place is perfect and accommodating. But for restaurants, the food is a biggest factor. I find the food nicely presented (instagrammable) yet, the taste is very average. Some flavors don’t go well together too. Like the ever savory sea urchin combined with black squid like pudding is great on the first spoonful, but can get sickening at the end. We also ordered a foamy crab and definitely nothing special. If there is one good food I would recommend, it’s the pork. Perfectly cooked and juicy. Even the burnt cheesecake is so-so.

Restaurant Ibid,Charmaine -,"Very well deserving of the close to 5 stars rating on Google!

Thoroughly enjoyed every dish from the starter bread (made by the team daily) to the finale (best cookie I’ve ever tasted + a very uniquely umami ice cream that goes super well with the cookie).

Not posting pics of the other dishes so every diner would be as pleasantly surprised as I was. Flavours for dishes were ALL on point, very delicious.

Chef woo, his team dan and elex went above and beyond to speak with all the diners as much as they could. Chef woo is super knowledgeable and creative. Hearing how he crafted his dishes is a reminder of the massive amount of effort behind the scenes to create such wonderful food!

Highly recommend, hope to return again!

49 SEATS,jason fun,"Honest review here.

Customer service: Excellent 👍 Very polite & friendly staff. The first time somebody asked if we have enough cream for the carbonara. 11/10

Food: The carbonara tasted alright. Its not bad. But definitely not $20++ worthy. Smoke duck was tough and not smoky, quite abit of fats/skin. Portion wasnt really alot as per mentioned in other review (Also found a hair in the spaghetti). The escargot wasnt good, tasted more of the flour, flour itself wasnt fragrant. The chicken wings are not bad. The fries is the best out of all. It still taste good & crispy even after it cool down.

Plating: The plating for the carbonara is pretty bad given that its $20++. Using a metal plate that is probably used in a canteen. When i try to peel my chicken wing it doesnt stabilize on the table, the plate will spin as i peel.

Waiting time was alittle long for the fact that there was only 3 tables occupied when im there. Food was out in about 30 mins?

Conclusion, the food isnt that value for dollar. The best way to conclude is that the food are worth 15% lesser than it is priced.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/49+SEATS/@1.3548586,103.686695,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1996c70a229f:0x56591f7656715260!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1996c7f3344d:0xe525cb715e06baa0!8m2!3d1.3013475!4d103.8400527!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBRENpOURRVWxSUVVOdlpFTm9kSGxqUmpsdlQyNVNVVmRHYUV0VVNGbzBaSHBXVVdReFpEWmFla3BVWXpCSmRHRklZeEFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCIIBEEs!16s%2Fg%2F11dfsw5lnh"

Nice sesame taste and fragrance. The noodles are a bit on the softer side. Slightly dry but not too clumpy and the noodles are still well coated with flavourful sauce

𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐃𝐨𝐮 𝐏𝐢
Didnt quite enjoy this as the tofu skin is thin, chewy and kind of oily. Also found the glutinous rice kind of bland and the flavour comes mostly from the diced meat which is dry, hard and salty

𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐨 𝐌𝐚𝐢
It’s not like your usual siumai as this one comes with glutinous rice. The glutinous rice here is peppery and more flavourful than the one in the dou pi. The diced meat here is also tender probably since it’s steamed

𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐎𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐮𝐬 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐞
Very starchy and the overall flavours are pretty mild imo..couldn’t really taste both the osmanthus and rice wine

POCHA! Korean Street Dining (Jem),Christopher Wong,"First time trying this korean street dining restaurant, but was a bit disappointed with the service. I ordered my food at 1:10pm, most of the tables were served, maybe left 1 or 2 tables of guests waiting for their food. They served me my drink and then 6 pieces chicken, but my main dish was taking forever. I have to even pace my chicken wings so I won't finish them before my main fish come. I was having my last piece of chicken at 1:33, finally 1:35 my noodles came. While i was waiting i googled jjapagetti because i have never tried before - ""also known as Chapagetti, is a popular Korean instant noodle dish made by Nongshim, known for its black bean sauce flavor. It's the second most popular ramyeon (ramen) in South Korea and was the first instant noodle product to resemble the Chinese dish jjajangmyeon."" - according to google. Wow, it is an instant noodle product but it took close to half hour to cook! While having my 2nd last piece of chicken i still saw the kitchen chefs walking around, they didn't have anything else to cook i wondered. It was only then one of the 2 staff came and check my order - 11-1:30pm, the restaurant not even half full but they only have 2 staff + 1 manager, clearly they still lack of manpower. The staff didn't apologize for missing my order or whatsoever. Last part, the noodles was warm, but the ham and egg are cold. 😒 im not angry, im upset and disappointed.
Edit: i just made payment and reflected to the manager, she was chasing for another table's order too.

Murugan Vilas Idly,Tejasri Gopi,"Had dinner here, we spent 20$ for 4 of us.
I usually don’t give a “3 star or less” review unless there’s something terribly wrong with the food.
Firstly, the Gobi manchurian smelled so bad. We took one piece each and threw away the rest.
Secondly, we felt dehydrated right after eating, so much so that we were up in the bed for the next 3h.
Plus we started burping. And felt acid reflux . There’s something in the vada, dosa and idly batter (may be too much soda??) !

Milan Shokudo,Yi Ling,"Came here for lunch on a weekday, and it was my 1st time dining at Milan Shokudo, which I have heard the food options be similar to Saiz*riya but the Halal version! I'm quite excited to try this place when I know I can bring my Muslim friends here!

💧 Water is complimentary & and self-service.

Price range starts from $6-$13 for mains for an aglio olio, which is pretty okay-ish for price. We wanted to order the lunch set deals, but the online product listing kept switching on and off? I'm not sure if it's a bug glitch because we can't order the pasta set either, when the hot plate set was the only one off. Yet when we checked with the staff again, the hot plate was back on, but the pasta was not. A lot of the items were also out of stock during lunch hour as well. We kinda gave up figuring it out and just ordered ala carte pasta.

🍤 Basil Prawn Pasta did not look like the photos, but it was still not bad. It leans towards the cream sauce with basil style with 4 shrimps & 2 salad leaves. Portion size is small, and the handmade pasta had a texture closer to korean ramyun, which was.. interesting.
I rate: 3/5 🌟

🦐 Seafood Tom Yum Pasta was pretty okay as well. Sauce has a prominent sour tang of a tom Yum Soup, as ingredients consisted of shrimps, clams, and scallops. Pasta like the above was chewy and wavy like korean ramyun.
I rate: 3/5 🌟

I am keen to try more dishes here in the future even though food isn't that amazing or bad.

Artichoke,Agnes Goh,Food is superb only down side is the bar table seating. We booked and pay deposit via credit card and told only can choose bar table. Most of the place bar table is fine as we can see the cooking station but this place we were seated facing the washing station. In the photo you can see chef cooking with their back facing us so practically we can’t see any cooking stuff except the washing part 😠 we asked to shift table and they said only outdoor is applicable as that is for walk-in. You expect us to seat outdoors with the terrible humidity weather and don’t forget we paid for reservations with the extra effort of booking.

OCEAN Restaurant,Sky Chia,"Bought my wife for the anniversary lunch as she is from oversea. Reservation needs to be done at least a few months in advance as according to the serving staff there.

I did it like 3 weeks in advance due to an impromptu request from my wife to celebrate our anniversary. In additional we had also requested for any seat next to the fishes.

The location is a bit hard to find from the carpark to another carpark. And finally found the place.

We were set to a location where there was a super big pillar and yet paying the same pricing as the restaurant customers. The experience wasn't that great despite our advanced information being given to the restaurant. If only this carefully address to.

I think if the restaurant can pay ABIT attention and if the view wasn't available can keep us in the loop as leaving is an options to other restaurants and not with regrets.

Lastly we had to wait till 1 of the family tables had finished their meal then we requested to have our seats changed before the serving of the deserts.

Colony,Wanderer Wanderer,"3 star based on buffet menu value.
(Non-seafood night, Sunday)

If you are here for buffet menu value, you will be disappointed.

The seafood section serves snow crab, prawns, mussels, clams. Oysters are not an option, at least on Sunday when I patronized. You might be able to find it on seafood night.

Chili crab was not available as well. The closest you can get to chili crab is the mantou accompanied by the chili crab sauce beside it. If you are adventurous, the fried soft shell crab combined with chili crab sauce might satisfy your chili crab craving. All that oil in the fried soft shell crab will make you feel jelat quickly.

There is basic selection of sashimi and nigiri, I find the lack of premium cut like Mekajiki (Swordfish) disappointing.

There are live stations serving local and international food like laksa, chicken rice, roasted meat. The dessert selection was great, there was a wide selection of confectionery. Those with  sweet tooth will be thrilled.

I find that there is a great selection of cheese and cold cut meat, the best out of the buffets I’ve been to so far.

Encore by Rhubarb,Steph Sia,"Food was delicious and well-executed (the dessert, mackerel and truffle emulsion were the best out of our 4-course meal) but the lack of care in service killed it for me. Cold, inattentive service from the minute we walked in. Treated as “American tourists” (we are not) with second class service. All 4 other tables (mostly business and a honeymooner) were touched by Chef and we were only spoken as he got the door for us as we had to walk up and pay our bill (all other tables the check was brought to). No napkin service, water glasses left nearly empty for my partner, table was not pulled out for her, asking me for my allergies although it was indicated on the reservation - all of which are fairly standard for service, albeit for non-Michelin rated restaurants.

As a 20+ year veteran in the hospitality and luxury travel industry, I was very disappointed and appalled at this service. Was it the way we were dressed, in summer clothing because it was our last day sightseeing in Singapore? Because I only wanted one glass of wine with my lunch?

USP is that they fry some of the ingredients like fish, potato, and lotus. But it’s heavy and they charged by the weight. So imagine getting your eggs, lotus and potato. Heavier than meat 😂 However, I probably wouldn’t reorder the fried items as they were quite dry and oily, with no seasoning or marination. We ended up dipping the fried items into our Mala soup.

Ingredients were fresh, but there were a lot of flies around the sauce station, where you help yourself to peanuts, spring onions, and their “secret powder.”

Nurul Delights Nasi Lemak,Tiff,"Inconsistent standard.

Reminded Kak about the egg in the nasi lemak, opened packet, no egg. So essentially just chicken wing and cucumber.

Before I sound like a complainy Singaporean, hear me out.

About the nasi lemak: Taste-wise, on good days, it’s nice. Rice consistency either fluffy or clumped together (too wet). The lemak though in the rice, is pretty much always on point. Just nice, not over or underwhelming.

Sambal chili with it is always great. If you’re lucky, you get the chicken wings that are just out of the fryer- otherwise you end up with one that’s been sitting in the tray for awhile.

USED TO LOVE THIS PLACE, but wow… quality dropped so much 😭💔 Friday night was packed—understandable, but service felt SO rushed 😦😦staff even told us not to take time bc “too many customers” 💀 Side dishes used to be amazing but now it’s more like PURE MSG + sugar bombs 🥲 couldn’t even get refills bc staff was way too busy LOL 😮‍💨💦

🍜 Egg Ramyeon ($10) ⭐️⭐️⭐️/5
Came in cool metal pot, and noodles WERE SO bouncy & springy, cooked perfectly 🔥 broth was SUPER CREAMY 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️ BUT instead of whole egg, everything was just mixed in 😔😔 not too salty BUT RANDOM CHILI PIECES??? 🌶️💀 ITS BIRDS EYE CHILI SUMMORE LOL 😝😝 super unexpected and kinda threw everything off HAHAH 😥😥😥 no meat, just some random vegetables which was q weird.. 🥬 + WAIT TIME BRO HOW did this take SO LONG 😭 Even cold noodles arrive faster 💀

❄️ Mul Naengmyeon ($17) ⭐️/5
HUGE portion, icy cold broth, came with scissors YAY 🧊🔥temperature was SUPER PERFECT RLLY COLD 💗💗 BUT THE NOODLES OMG LOWK WAS like chewing rubber band HAHAH 😭 SO clumpy and tough def undercooked.. 🥲 kept biting into random chunks of stuck-together noodles LOL 💔 AND THE SOUP OMT… so SALTY, plus had super strong beefy MSG taste (p sure it’s Dashida HAHAH 😭) which completely overpowered everything 🫠 ONLY saving grace WAS BEEF 🔥 not stingy, slices were SO TENDER SUPER SOFT AND YUMMY 🥩💖 Pickled radish in broth was p gd contrast well w salty broth LOL

Actually heartbreaking bc this place used to be so good, but now?? Kinda sad 🫠 Food came out fast (except ramyeon, weirdly), but service felt so off—literally hurrying us to leave 💀 Side dishes tasted so artificial, naengmyeon was painful to eat 💔 Only thing worth considering is ramyeon, if you don’t mind waiting forever for it ig 😮‍💨

Nalan Restaurant Little India,Dhananjay Garg,"Dropped by Nalan at Serangoon for lunch, excited to try their South Indian set and a few North Indian sides. While the flavors were definitely decent, the overall experience fell short due to portion sizes and slow service — especially considering the price point.

🍽 What We Ordered:

South Indian Set (Dosa, Idli, Vada with chutneys + sambar)

Malai Kofta

Mushroom Coconut Pepper Fry

Naan Basket

---

🌿 South Indian Set

The dosa was crisp, idli soft, and vada decent — classic Nalan style. But the chutneys were barely enough to cover even half the dosa, let alone three different items. Looked like they were rationing chutney by the teaspoon. We asked twice for extra chutney, and only on the third attempt did the server bring a tiny refill. The sambar was flavorful but also on the lower side in quantity.

---

🍛 North Indian Dishes

The Malai Kofta tasted great, but the serving had just two koftas drowning in a bowl full of gravy. Not ideal when you’re sharing. We had to order an extra sabji (Mushroom Coconut Pepper Fry) to make up for it, which took a long time to arrive.

The Naan Basket was also underwhelming. For something that’s supposed to be shared between two people, the amount of naan was surprisingly little. Definitely not enough carbs to go around with two mains.

---

🧑‍🍳 Service & Price

The biggest downside was the slow service. Despite a half-full restaurant, we had to repeat ourselves multiple times to get basic things like chutney and extra plates. That dragged out the lunch longer than it needed to be.

For the price, we expected better quantity or at least quicker service. The pricing is on par with larger restaurants in Singapore, but the portions feel like a third of what you’d get elsewhere.

---

📝 Final Verdict

✅ Taste: On point for most dishes

❌ Quantity: Too small across the board

❌ Service: Slow and inattentive

❌ Value: Price doesn't match the experience

If you're visiting, expect good flavors but come with low expectations on quantity and some patience for service.

Creatr.,Matthew Lee,"Decided to try after reading some blogger who wrote about this place. There wasn't really a menu and the staff just verbally told what was available and basically we ordered each of everything. Service was a little slow even though there were only 6 people in the entire cafe. 1st was the rojak churro which was quite interesting, the churro was like the youtiao and the rest of the ingredients were wrapped in the rice paper. It tasted good but was kinda deconstructed didn't really know how to go about eating it.
The crab burger and Tofu fries was next. Burger was okay quite enjoyable and so was the Tofu fries with the dip sauce. I guess it was a good combination and the tofu fries would just seem kinda out of place by just ordering ala carte.
Last was the coffee pasta, which I thought was the ""disaster"" of the entire meal. Kinda hard to appreciate coffee taste on the pasta, which left a bitter aftertaste even after the meal. On the other hand the beef that went along with the pasta was so well cooked the meat was very tender and juicy. I think it was cooked separately and later added to the pasta before serving so it didn't really have much of the coffee taste (which I said thank God).",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Creatr./@1.3394886,103.6691575,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0ff1d0afa43b:0x1fa1ef5ccd06ba7c!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1bbb24d86209:0xfdd585ad29017978!8m2!3d1.3363451!4d103.7135747!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEXZnJvemVuX2Rlc3NlcnRfc3VwcGxpZXKaASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUm9iSEF6WldSUkVBRaoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAEDs!16s%2Fg%2F11rc3l1hfj"

Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin),oXRYSTALo Ong,"Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin): A Late-Night Dim Sum Haven with Budget-Friendly Bites

Alright, folks, listen up! My friends and I were craving a late-night dim sum fix after an our bike ride, and we stumbled upon Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin). This place was tucked away in a quiet corner, a little off the beaten path, but it was open 24 hours, which was perfect for our late-night cravings.

The Good:

• The Price: The dim sum was incredibly affordable. They had a deal where you could get a free basket of dim sum for every 10 baskets you bought, making it incredibly budget-friendly.  That was a huge plus, especially when compared to other dim sum places where a similar amount could easily cost you double or even triple the price.

• The Convenience: It was the perfect spot for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly. It was open 24 hours, which was a major plus for us!  It was the perfect place to satisfy a late-night craving. Plus, there was a large car park nearby, making parking a breeze.

The Quirks:

• The Food: The dim sum menu had a lot of variety, but honestly, the taste was just average. The har gow and siu mai, classic dim sum dishes, didn't really wow us.

• The Coffee Shop: The drink stall next to the dim sum stall only accepted cash, so keep that in mind.

My Friend’s Note: I love that it’s open 24 hours! It’s great to have a place I can go to for dim sum whenever I want!

My Note: The price is great, but I think the food could be better.

Rating:

• Food: 3/5 (Just okay, not the best dim sum)

• Service: 3.5/5 (Acceptable)

• Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (Okay ambience)

Overall: 3/5

Overall: The ambience was decent, and the service was fine, but it was the affordability and the 24-hour availability that really stood out. It’s a good option for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly.  I'd say if you're in the area, it's worth popping in to give it a try, but if you're a serious dim sum connoisseur, you might want to check out other options.

Ka-Soh,いんえ-どの,"Definitely must have the prawn paste chicken as a side. The sour sweet pork was also good but I prefer the onions to be more crispy and raw (on a good note, this means no raw onion breath).

Beehoon fish soup too fishy for me despite coming with the knowledge from the other reviews. Managed to finish the ingredients but couldn't drink 95% of the soup, would recommend them to add ginger to broth/soup remove fishy smell and it also acts complimentary to the dish.

Lastly, the Sliced Fish Hor Fun is a bit too charred and doesn't blend well with the tasteless kway two, don't eat it after or before u eat the fish bee hoon, it will shock your taste buds, making the food feel intolerable to even continue eating. It can pair slightly better with the sweet and sour pork. They also only serve traditional tea/water and don't have kopi or teh options.

Toilet is unbearable even if I just wash hands there, so do bring tissues and visit toilet before going there. The setting was okay, became quite loud for a while because of big group gatherings at the back. Queue time longer during the start of lunch hour, came there earlier and thankfully managed to get seats after ten minutes.

Do note that you need to walk quite a bit as it sits in the middle a row of houses. I came here because I heard it was closing in Sep. Is it worth it?

Flutes,Sihan Goi,"Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday, with high expectations, given the awesome reviews. First impression was good - ambience was bright and spacious, with high ceilings and classy decor. Service was attentive, but I felt it was a bit impersonal and lacked a certain warmth. Nevertheless, we got everything we needed, and staff did all the necessary for a fine dining restaurant such as pulling our seats back and forward as we sat down. So far, so good. We ordered 2 executive set lunches, and I opted to top up $18 for the Wagyu rump. We selected the carpaccio and truffle mushroom soup for starters. The carpaccio was very thinly sliced and not bad, but the mushroom soup lacked oomph, and I couldn't taste much truffle. I've had heartier mushroom soups at buffet lines, so not a good start food wise. For the mains, we had the farro risotto, and I got the Wagyu rump...which was quite a mistake because despite paying an extra $18, I got a slab of beef that was perhaps 150 to 180g tops, which I couldn't tell was Wagyu, as it lacked any discernible marbling, and was even a tad powdery. My wife enjoyed her risotto much more, but I wasn't a fan either. By then I was quite disappointed with the food, and the dessert didn't do much to redeem the meal. The entire meal came up to be about $150, and for that price, I could go to many places for a better meal - perhaps not as good as ambience nor service, but to me, food quality is the most important metric.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flutes/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a10d58cbe1:0xfe2123698d21169a!8m2!3d1.2973463!4d103.857383!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSUE9IQkliMVYzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECFYQNQ!16s%2Fg%2F1thsnxnk"

Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,Yunn,"My family and I used to frequent Crystal Jade for their noodles with minced meat & mushroom. Came again in June 2025 and to our disappointment, this dish is no longer on the menu.

The menu has been updated for what is currently popular - mala, sour fish, etc which I personally think is not a very smart move. If I wanted to eat mala & sour fish, I would head to a China chain where they are established experts on that flavour profile.

Nevertheless, we tried the sour fish la mian. It's okay. It's not bad but it's not good either - fish is dry, although soup is flavourful and spicy.

Thankfully their dim sum has remained the same, quality and enjoyable although not the best out there. The dishes were served very quickly, although it took us almost 15 minutes to get seated when there were several empty tables.

The staff are pretty good and are trying their best, but the truth is this place is understaffed and you can feel it. Thankfully the kitchen doesn't seem to be understaffed.

NAEUM Restaurant,V L,"TL;DR

Despite the commendable service, it was the ambience that fell short of expectations for a premium dining experience, particularly considering prices potentially exceeding $1,000, which presents a challenge in justifying a return visit.

Full review-

Ambience:

Upon arrival, the open layout of the restaurant was unexpected, deviating from the anticipated intimate atmosphere characteristic of high-end dining establishments. The proximity of larger tables the could fit 4 or more led to a noisy environment, detracting from the overall dining experience.

Notably during my service, the noise level was such that the service staff had to speak louder to ensure I could hear their introductions of the dishes.

The absence of private rooms, if any, was conspicuous, leaving patrons without the option of a more secluded setting.

Food/drinks:

While the presentation of each dish was meticulous and visually appealing, some fell short in terms of flavour complexity. Notably, the fish dish lacked seasoning, resulting in a rather bland taste profile despite the accompanying sauce.

Service:

On a positive note, the service provided was exemplary, with staff demonstrating attentiveness and a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.

Their willingness to accommodate dietary preferences and offer detailed explanations of each dish added to the overall dining experience, mitigating some of the shortcomings in other areas.

Would I return?

Kay-Tu Myanmar Cuisine - Boon Lay,lontongstroong,"Seems much of the dishes are more akin to home-cooked Burmese version of Economic Rice (veggies and meat combi), although the usual iconic menus like Mohinga (bee hoon soup), Burmese briyani, and Lahpet Thoke (fermented tea leaves salad) also make appearances. There's always Burmese customers lining up to buy meals during dinner time, so you know what they serve are authentic.

The Burmese economic rice was relatively well-priced for such a cuisine that is foreign to local Singaporeans (like $4-5), thus making it popular among Burmese diaspora in the area. Tastes stronger than other Southeast Asian cuisines - you can tell there's rather substantial Indian (Bengali) influences in it. Their mohinga was served in pretty large portion with thick soup.

IKEA Jurong Restaurant,thelevitator,"Amazing food, albeit at a cost. Me and my friends decided to have lunch here on 05072024. The spaghetti bolognese ($10.50) was delicious, although the cheese placement could be changed. The Swedish meatballs (8 pcs for $7.50) were tasty, and the vegetables were well-cooked. The salmon ($11.50) is probably not worth spending on, the amount of fish you get was pitifully small. The cheesecake ($4) was ok for me, although my friends claimed that the berries in the cheesecake were ""expired""(?). The crunchy almond chocolate cake ($4) is one to order though, it was delicious. The mashed potatoes were pitifully small (when ordered solo, it cost $1.50). However, the chicken wings ($1 per chicken wing on Fridays) were amazing, although it's probably not a good idea to have this as your main course. The soup that I ordered (add on $2 for a set) was average at best, but the garlic bread saved the day. What was worth it however was the ice cream cone. For $0.50, you get a cone and deliciously cold soya ice cream. The taste of soya was not in the least obvious.

Ayasofya Turkish Restaurant,Giri K,"(Review for Vegetarians)

Ayasofya is an expensive restaurant just like all restaurants on this very touristy street. So, you not only pay for the good turkish food and the roadside ambience but also for its prime location near the Mosque.

I have tried almost all the Turkish restaurants in this street and elsewhere in Singapore. In my opinion, the food here is good but not too great if you factor in the price. For two persons, for just the vegetarian food shown in the pictures, it was 109.65S$.

The hummus was good but the lavash or balloon bread was too dry and a bit burnt for my taste. They also served falafels that were big and chunky unlike their neighbors on this street that serve coin sized, frozen-falafels. The restaurant opposite to this one, the Sultan Turkish restaurant, has slightly better food but the differences are marginal. But, hands down, the Sultan Turkish restaurant has the better kunefe with goat's milk ice cream.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ayasofya+Turkish+Restaurant/@1.3548586,103.686695,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19b11ef5b599:0xe92832402865d596!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da192f73b5b92f:0xe4ce11d6aca8d61e!8m2!3d1.3018398!4d103.8593332!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESdHVya2lzaF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJpTVhGMU0weDNFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABBM!16s%2Fg%2F11qqyh5xjs"

ANJU,Pam Lim,"I have very mixed feelings about this place because I've been here twice. The first time we came as a small pax of 2. Service was great and attentive, food excellent and dishes were amazing. However we chose to come here again for a large pax of 8, and booked this way in advance. Staff were inexperienced on the 2nd visit and did not seem knowledgeable on the dishes, and the tables were really not suited for larger pax. This place is not advisable for larger groups. But the food here cannot be faulted.

The best dishes here was the Bossam, Octopus and the bori prawn was addictive. It was well seasoned with chilli powder but not too overpowering. I wasn't a fan of the Tofu kimchi. The servings were meant to be small like tapas, to pair with makgeoli, but the serving size for the Bossam seemed unproportionately too much compared to the other dishes (although I guess usually Bossam has large portions).

Boon Lay Traditional Hakka Lui Cha,Winston Ho,"This stall sells Thunder tea rice/ Lei cha fun.

You have a choice of white or brown rice, and it’s topped with a medley of diced vegetables (long beans, cabbage, spinach) and beancurd that are stir-fried individually. They also add fried shrimp, which is rather rare for this dish. Peanuts are also added. If you take it away, the peanuts are provided in a separate packet.

The portion is big, good for big eaters or 2 persons

The dish comes with a “tea” paste, which is green in color. It’s a blend of herbs such as mint, coriander, Thai basil and tea leaves, along with an assortment of nuts, such as almond, peanuts and sesame They usually add hot water to it to make a soup.

The BOILER @ Buona Vista | Best Seafood Boil | Crabs & Lobsters |,Lyon .L,"Went to have a try with a friend here with no reservations at around 7 which is great. Had the medium duo bag with the sauce of the month. I would say it was pretty dang good though more buns would be great personally the seafood was pretty fresh especially the prawns though I wish it was more generous with the sausages and the corn as there were one piece each. And we ordered the Sri Lanka crab with garlic butter which was a lighter sauce and as well with their promo of 50% off which I don’t know if they did do the discount on the bill but! It was pretty good. And a little side we ordered was the wings those were honestly great with a nice crunch and to end it off we tried the lava cake which was nice with the side of ice cream as well. No complaints there staff were pretty friendly I would say though they came back twice just to check on the promo they were quite swift as well. Overall ambiance was pretty chill.

The risotto was actually really refreshing and tasty, while the pork belly wasn't fatty at all and it's honestly the first time I ate something like that, enjoyed the texture.

Lawry's The Prime Rib Singapore,Kian Huang Lim,"Visited Leary’s The Prime Rib, and I have to say the service and atmosphere were absolutely exceptional. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel right at home with their warm and attentive hospitality. The ambiance of the restaurant was classic and elegant, perfect for a relaxed yet upscale dining experience.

The spinning salad on ice not bad

For the meal, I started with the mushroom soup and the baby back pork ribs, which were delicious! Tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection – a definite highlight of the evening. However, I was a bit underwhelmed by the signature Lawry’s Cut Prime. While it was good, I was expecting a bit more flavor and tenderness, especially given the restaurant’s reputation. It didn’t quite live up to the hype, but overall, the meal was still enjoyable.

The White Label,Faith,"Had dinner here and it can get pretty noisy when crowded. We made a reservation and also stated it’s for birthday and they gave us a small complimentary cake!

While everything was tasteful, the price was on the high end. It has nice plating but it still doesn’t cover up for the smaller portion compared to the price. The quality was good but still not super amazing. The lobster bisque doesn’t actually have dumplings; it’s just 2 seafood balls made with paste. Truffle fries cant go wrong

The mains were actually served pretty slow (25-30 minutes wait?) yet the servers seemed really quick in wanting to clear out our plates even when we are clearly not finished and still cleaning the last bits of food we have. Had to tell them we were still eating several times when they asked if we wanted to clear. Not sure if it’s because there is a next reservation, but the food was served slower in the first place 🥲

The mock tails were good though so you can give it a try for the wide variety they have.

At the start when we got seated down, one of the server asked if we wanted still or sparkling water. We didn’t know it would be costed ($5 w/o taxes) for a bottle when there is actually refillable tap water available. Just to note for any other future customers getting asked the question 🥹

Would honestly give 3 stars for the food but the good side of the service pulled up the notch to a 4 stars.

elemen 元素,Tan Li Ting,"In line with Singapore’s 60th National Day, elemen's Local‑Licious 8‑course vegetarian set (S$38.80++ for members, $42.80++ otherwise) is a joyous celebration that reimagines our beloved local dishes.

Highlights from the menu:
🇸🇬Trio Local Appetiser Delicate char siew puff, mini roti prata with veggie curry, and chickpea‑tempeh chilli “crab” — a clever, colourful starter that winks at hawker classics.
🇸🇬 Salad Flatbread Rolls with Indian Rojak Dressing Crisp greens and fruit rolled in soft flatbread, drizzled with zesty assam‑infused Indian rojak sauce—bright, tangy and refreshingly fun.
🇸🇬 Peppery “Fish Maw” Soup Vegetarian “fish maw” with king oyster mushrooms, goji, red date broth, topped with crispy soy croutons—comforting, earthy, and subtly peppery.
🇸🇬 Lion’s Mane Satay Meaty lion’s mane mushrooms grilled, served with satay sauce and ketupat—satisfyingly charred and hearty, evoking classic street‑side skewers.
🇸🇬 Black Truffle Hainanese “Chicken” Rice Star of the menu - truffle‑infused rice with plant‑based “chicken”. It’s luxe yet familiar—a surprising twist on SG staple.
🇸🇬 Coconut Chendol Beancurd Pudding Creamy coconut pudding, pandan chendol, red beans, gula melaka—sweet, nostalgic, and silky.
🇸🇬 Radiance in a Cup Snow‑gum and red date drink to round off—light and refreshing with a “nest‑like” nourishing feel.

Red Lantern Live Seafood @ 921 Upper Bukit Timah Road,Liau Yuan Wei,"Brought my family there for weekend dinner.
Main gripe is that we wanted to order Curry Fish Head or Steamboat Fish Head ($38), but was told that both were sold out and the only fish left is the seasonal fish ($48). We got that in the end which was pretty large with much meat, just that I don’t know if the reason above is a smokescreen for us to spend more…

Anyway the Fingertips Chicken was amazing as the meat while tender, contained so much flavor from the spices used, so I was impressed how the chef infused the spices into the meat. The rest were decent too.

Free parking available at the building but limited lots, otherwise a lot of cars park along side the small road of the building.

Shan Cheng (Ipoh Delicacies) ● 山城 - Bukit Panjang Plaza,Jennifer,"Legend has it that the food here is so good that a tycoon flew a helicopter to Ipoh just to get a taste! Hence, the name Helicopter Rice ($10.80). Flooded with three kinds of curry, it is both aromatic and very spicy.

Ipoh Chicken Hor fun ($8.80) comes in both soup and dry versions. Paired with prawns and chives (prawns a bit overcooked).

A must-try for people who love fried food is the Golden Platter ($9 small, $14.90 large). Everything is made in Ipoh except for the fishballs. The turnip in the middle is naturally sweet, no condiments needed.

For drinks, don’t leave without their White Coffee ($2.60 hot, $3.30 cold) or Milk Tea Latte ($4.80). I swear, the tea is so fragrant, with a frothy creamy top.

Niqqi's The Cheese Prata Shop,Sumaer singh,"A Deliciously Flaky Experience at Niqqi's The Cheese Prata Shop, Clementi*

Tucked away in the bustling neighborhood of Clementi, Niqqi's The Cheese Prata Shop is a hidden gem that has been tantalizing taste buds with its delectable cheese pratas. As a self-proclaimed prata enthusiast, I was excited to try their signature dish and see if it lives up to the hype.

Upon entering the shop, I was greeted by the friendly staff and the aroma of freshly baked prata. The menu boasted an impressive array of prata options, but I stuck to the classic cheese prata. The verdict? Absolutely delightful!

The cheese prata was cooked to perfection, with a crispy, flaky crust giving way to a gooey, cheesy center. The cheese was generously portioned, and the prata itself was cooked just right – not too oily, not too dry. Each bite was a masterful balance of flavors and textures that left me craving for more.

What sets Niqqi's apart from other prata shops is the attention to detail and commitment to quality. The ingredients are fresh, and the cooking technique is evident in every bite. The shop's cozy atmosphere and friendly service only add to the overall experience.

While the cheese prata is undoubtedly the star of the show, I also tried their egg prata, which was equally impressive. The egg was cooked just right, with a runny yolk that added a rich, creamy texture to the dish.

In conclusion, Niqqi's The Cheese Prata Shop is a must-visit destination for anyone who loves good food and great company. With its mouth-watering cheese pratas and welcoming atmosphere, this shop is sure to become a favorite among locals and visitors alike. Whether you're a prata aficionado or just looking for a delicious meal, Niqqi's is definitely worth a try.

Odette,Ada K,"Dining at Odette was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with such warmth and attentiveness that it felt less like being treated as royalty, and more like being truly honoured guests — graciously and thoughtfully looked after from start to finish.

The 7-course dégustation was divine. Each dish was a delicate balance of flavour, technique, and creativity — and the way the food was presented felt almost like a performance. There was a sense of quiet theatre in the room, with fellow diners visibly in awe as each course arrived. It was beautiful to witness — a shared appreciation for artistry on the plate.

The mushroom soup was a comforting and elegant standout, while the dumpling and the egg dish showcased incredible finesse. And surprisingly, the pigeon — something I wouldn’t normally gravitate toward — was absolutely delicious, prepared to perfection.

Their beverage selection was extensive and thoughtfully curated, perfectly complementing the meal. And the service? Flawless. Every interaction felt genuine, knowledgeable, and perfectly timed.

One-Ninety Restaurant,Sihan Goi,"One of the best buffet quality I've had in a long time. Had the semi buffet on valentines day with my wife and this is basically a salad bar buffet for $58/pax, and you can add on an entree for an extra $10. They also had wines for $14/glass, but this was only limited to a specific red and white wine. The buffet spread isn't very wide, but the quality was fantastic. Almost everything was a hit. Other tab the cold cuts and salads, there was also basis breads, a cheese station, and desserts. I especially enjoyed the soup of the day, which was a corn and crab soup - something I would not order normally and was actually disappointed in hearing about, but when it came and I tried it, I changed my mind immediately - it was that good. One Ninety, if you're reading this, you need to put this soup in your regular menu rather than have it as soup if the day.

For the entrees, I had the salmon and my wife had the duck leg, and both were very solid. The duck leg came with a sauce that tastes like Peking duck sauce, very creative and the meat was fall if the bone. The salmon came with an unknown sauce that looks a bit like pesto or chimichuri,but want very tasty. Nevertheless the salmon was fresh and succulent and cooked perfectly.

Dessert selection wasn't very wide either, but several of them were good. The $14 wines however didn't tickle our fancy, so we got the regular wines, which was very good. Comes with coffee or tea at the end too. I had a café latte while my wife had a decaf café latte. Both were unexpectedly good for a hotel buffet. In fact better than many cafes. Total came up to about $250 for 2 pax.

Service was excellent - professional, polite, earnest, but not overbearing. Pretty much the gold standard. Even the junior waiters seemed properly trained.

Springleaf Prata Place - Junction 10,Nuno Fidalgo,Small coffee shop with indoor and outdoor seating. I love the prata here and the butter chicken.

Marguerite,Zane,"From the start till the end, what an experience. I would give 6 stars to both the services and foods.

The buggy ride was a godsend on a sunny day and the sense of luxury really started from there. The restaurant was naturally scented from what I presumed coming from the flowers in the flower dome. It wasn’t over powering the sense of smell.

The 4 courses lunch with a choice of wagyu or lamb was splendidly prepared. I liked the lamb better though. Overall, I enjoyed the journey that the chef curated for the taste buds.

The service staffs were attentive and professional. It’s commendable that they didn’t try to sell you bottled still water but served refreshing cold complementary water. I was also surprised by the reasonably priced tea to pair with the mignardises.

The cherry to top off the wonderful time was the free entry into the flower dome.

Soi Thai Kitchen,Gregory Lim,"Food is excellent!

Their Basil pork minced rice is exceptional. One of the best I've had

My gf tried their Beef noodle soup and it was good too.

They don't leave the condiments at each table and that is a downer. Hence, I needed to ask for them at the counter making it difficult to get the right amount of sauces for the right taste

Will be even better if they just leave the condiment box at each table

Price wise it is good especially if you take their lunch set

Normally Basil pork rice already and the Thai Green tea cost $11.20

But if you take the set, it is only $9.90 and comes with red ruby desert (pre inclusion of GST)

They only extra charge is GST and does not have service charge 👍

Candlenut,Rui Yang How,"It has been my long-running wish to dine at Candlenut. Rather than feeling exquisitely modern like typical Michelin restaurants, Peranakan cuisine is typically cooked with thoughtful preparation and tastes like how your grandma(in SEA) would cook! Like most Asian cultures, it is best in a group of 4-5 so you can order multiple dishes a la carte. For couples, there’s still the ah-ma-kase!

Chef’s Mum’s Chicken Curry
One of the signature items in Candlenut, the curry is on the sweeter end and is very ‘lemak’ (aromatic) from the coconut milk. The chicken is not fall-off-the-bone but retains its texture while being easy peel off the bone. Get this with white rice!

Candlenut Buah Keluak Fried Rice
A must order signature dish! Buah Keluak is a nut that gives the fried rice a nutty profile (obviously). It is slightly spiced and has a surprisingly good wok hey to it. Make sure to break the yolk to give it an extra creaminess.

Cassava Kueh
Never ever skip dessert at Candlenut. Other than the signature Chendol, this kueh was really mind blowing. It’s a kueh(cake) uses grated tapioca base, topped with a custard layer that is wonderfully brulee - giving it a flan-like flavour. Make sure to have scoops of the Gula Melaka sorbet in between!",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Candlenut/@1.3035473,103.6216819,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1a22d572f9a3:0x3d3abeeadc17465a!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da19720b8724e7:0x5101e3c43062ecbb!8m2!3d1.3058022!4d103.810095!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERbnlvbnlhX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUndPVGhIT0hKQlJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIFBBI!16s%2Fg%2F1pp2txrmr"

The star of the presentation is the blue pea flower rice, its vibrant hue naturally derived and paired with a medley of aromatic dishes. Each compartment holds a well-balanced variety — from tender, flavorful meat dishes to rich, fragrant curries, accompanied by crunchy pickles and crispy crackers for texture contrast.

Every bite offers layers of flavor: the tangy-sweet sambal, the earthy spices of slow-cooked meat, and the gentle coconut aroma of the rice all harmonize beautifully. The meal is thoughtfully portioned — hearty enough to satisfy, but light enough to leave you comfortably full.

To wash it down, the drinks selection ranges from refreshing citrus-based coolers to aromatic teas, each complementing the richness of the meal. Presentation is top-notch; the combination of Peranakan artistry and modern plating elevates the dining experience beyond just taste.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cherki/@1.2794687,103.8043118,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1913ee7e0e77:0x172a38b0778602aa!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19719bcb39cf:0x3d8316071d7503d9!8m2!3d1.275766!4d103.8496856!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOWE4xcHRhR1JSRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQQw!16s%2Fg%2F11rgg0q14b"

Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin),Alden Ng,"A great place for a quick dim sum bite at a really affordable price. The variety available here is impressive, with many selections to choose from ranging from the usual classics like siew mai, har gow, char siew bao, and chee cheong fun, to other tasty small plates that make it easy to order a spread for sharing. Every dish I tried was tasty and freshly prepared, with quality comparable to what you would expect at other dim sum shops. Portion sizes are also reasonable and consistent with typical dim sum standards, so you can order a good mix without feeling that the servings are too small.

What makes this spot even better is that it’s housed within a coffee shop that also offers plenty of other food choices. This makes it very convenient if you are visiting with friends or family who might prefer different dishes beyond dim sum. You can easily mix and match, sharing plates from the dim sum stall alongside noodles, rice, or other hawker favourites available within the same space. It really adds to the overall dining experience and makes it suitable for groups of all ages.

The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, perfect for a fuss-free meal. Service is quick, and food is served hot, so it’s ideal if you’re in the area and just want a satisfying meal without waiting too long. Parking is also not an issue here—the carpark is located just beside the coffee shop with plenty of available lots. The rates are affordable compared to other busy areas, which makes it even more convenient for those driving.

Overall, this is a reliable and budget-friendly choice for dim sum lovers looking for good variety, value for money, and easy accessibility.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dim+Sum+Express+(Kuai+Can+Dian+Xin)/@1.4425116,103.7625297,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da16e6b8e20cbd:0xf066cfb5fe5fbcac!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da13a5fd4ebbdd:0x806dd9d94bcc3d8!8m2!3d1.4357569!4d103.8054455!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESZGltX3N1bV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVE1TVRVeVduWlJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECHIQIw!16s%2Fg%2F11h6qkfrhp"

JINJJA Chicken,--,"Great food, but would like to highlight one thing for the sake of the staff members.

There is a very sweet older lady, and we appreciate her attentiveness to her customers. She asked us how the food was, and even gave us a takeaway box with extra plastic bag when we asked for just the box to takeaway. For employer reference, it was the attendant on the floor on 8th of August during my time sitting from 12:45pm to 1:30pm.

Separately however, because of the 60 cent wing promotion, I felt that there were a few things that went wrong with the queueing system because of the large crowd. Upon arriving, we noted that there was the sign that said to get a seat inside before also queueing for the food. Hence my family members got a seat closer to when we were approaching the cashier. We were directed by a “frantic” staff member who told us to stay in the “having here” queue. However, when we were second from the cashier, she told us we queued up wrongly and would have to go to the back of the line because we were in the “seat” queue instead of the “food” queue. I’ve been queuing for about 20 minutes, and being asked to queue at the back of the line after being misdirected by the same staff herself was very off-putting. Also, she kept jabbing and tapping my arm the entire time she was asking me to go to the back of the line…. Not cool please. I’m hoping it never happens to me again as a regular customer of jinjja. Thankfully (also i guess she didn’t wanna escalate the situation) she opened up her cashier to rectify and de-escalate.

My 5 stars comes from a place of love for the food and experience crafted by some of the staff members. But i do wish that the issues i’ve addressed in this review can be taken seriously by upper management. Please do not put your staff in the situation where they are stressed out by the sudden promotion and crowd, and designate proper signage to help both your customers and staff.

The French Ladle,Shang Hum,"Went there for lunch with parents and sibling. These people are hardcore Chinese foodies. So when I suggested this French place, they really gave me that doubtful look. Parking is a breeze (weekday) and I got the nearest lot to the restaurant.

Went in and was greeted by the handsome chef and his partner. Brought us to our table and we starting looking at the menu. We ordered the set menu which was a really good deal in my opinion. The food came after a while and we started pecking.

The fish was my favorite, outside is crispy with a moist inside. Mash and veg was also spot on 9/10. Beef stew which we topped up for the dish was under seasoned. After adding more salt it became very delightful. Meat is soft and tender, mash and veg spot on as well 7.5/10. Chicken dish is also very good (round shaped) it came with a sauce that compliment it very well 7.5/10. Desert is okay, nothing much to brag about 6/10.

Braci,Janice Lee,"After the wonderful and memorable lunch I had at Braci many years ago, I have been thinking of going back again. And the International Women’s Day Special at Braci gave me the exact motivation to push aside all my commitments, prior plans and beauty appointment to come here to enjoy these specially curated dishes, with southeast Asian influences, created by the female chefs at Braci. This is one of the best dining experiences I have.

Instead of serving pure Italian food for the special occasion, the dishes in the menu feature European cuisine with Southeast Asian influences, inspired by the chefs’ backgrounds. I totally love it. There are so many flavours packed in beautiful harmony within each dish, It is complex and spellbinding.

I opt to dien at the exciting rooftop bar with a quaint bar counter and 270 ° panoramic unblocked view of the Singapore River, the landscape of Marina Bay and skyline of the city. It is so breathtaking, and the soft breeze blowing makes it even better Yes, I feel like I’m living it up when dining here.

The service is exceptional, impeccable and friendly, completing the exceptional experience of savouring awesome food with awesome ambience and service.

Makan Makan by Chef Li Vian is a lovely trio of Tom Kha Kai, Corn Tarlet and Scallop Semifreddo. I love the transition from simulating taste of Tom Kha Kai to smokiness of Corn Tarlet, and finally to luxurious treat of Scallop Semifreddo.

Suan Ni Bai Rou by Chef Aaron is one of the best pork dish I have. With the pork belly soaked with wine, sprinkled with fried shallots, paired with umami rich Sakura Ebi Furikake and zesty cool Cucumber Snow, the medley of rich flavours is amazing.

Aglio&Olio, But I don't like Garlic is very interestingly named by its creater, Chef Yoke. Given a twist to Braci's signature 32 Egg Yolks Tagliolini with creamy sweet Bafun Uni, which is by the way the best pasta, garlic foam and hamaguri clams are added for the extra oomph in taste and crunchy texture. The Tagliolini here is a must-try.

Tropical Tart by Pastry Chef Yasmin is a delightful dessert made up of mango mousse, passion fruit and coconut sorbet. Full of nuanced flavours, it tastes refreshing and rich at the same time. I love it.

Jovis Cafe - The Dining Place,David Oon,"Delish steak, curry chicken in a chill place.

First time, and definitely not the last. Ordered the meat platter for 2-3. Loved the caramelized steak! Super umami, with natural flavour, enhanced by the peppers and salt. Very well executed in medium, such that it's still tender and raw enough, without being too dry. The sausage was crunchy and tasty. A tad of a let down was the lamb. The taste is good, without being overly gamey, but done in medium made it a bit tough. The cuts selected for the price point is not my source of complaint. I'll probably make it a medium rare the next time round.

Another hit is the Mummy's Curry Chicken. It comes with 4 drumsticks, and 6 to 7 huge soft brastagi potatoes, chilling in a thick, spicy, delish, yet not overly hot gravy. Yums! We mopped it all up with the baguette.

The 4 seasons thin crust pizza was also another hit. A 10 inch size that comes in 4 flavours. I managed only to grab the ham and turkey slice, before it was cleared by my other hungry kakis, and that was good! Many agree that the mushroom slice is yums! Generous with the proteins and cheese. Ingredients were fresh and made for a good starter.

The fried chicken cutlet with waffle was decently good, but was overshadowed by the other 3 mains.

The drinks menu is also very extensive, both for non and alcoholic types.

Service is welcoming and the atmosphere is so chill and relaxed! Great place to chat and chill with the family.

Will be back again! 🙂",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jovis+Cafe+-+The+Dining+Place/@1.3205816,103.6123815,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1a9972dd0b61:0x4bde2119986fc639!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a996d86cecf:0x5e3bb8ff8a65500!8m2!3d1.3205816!4d103.7565771!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSQkxUVlVWa2RSRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCLYCEEw!16s%2Fg%2F11g86nvf88"
