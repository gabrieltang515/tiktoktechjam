OCEAN Restaurant,Klaus W.,"Firstly A few words about directions:
If you’re driving, be sure to read the access instructions carefully. The restaurant’s entrance is discreetly tucked away within the Resorts World Sentosa Car Park, which can be a bit tricky to locate if you’re unfamiliar with the area. For those using a ride-hailing service, it’s wise to bring a printed copy of the directions from your confirmation email, I assume many drivers, including ours, weren’t aware of this hidden gem.
As an added perk, the restaurant provides complimentary access to Sentosa Gateway, saving non-residents the usual entry fee.

Secondly once inside, everything unfolded seamlessly. From the moment we arrived, the evening blossomed into a truly delightful experience, The entire team was remarkably attentive and genuinely welcoming. A special shoutout goes to Rona, who orchestrated the evening with effortless grace and precision. From the impeccable timing of each dish to the harmonious pairing of drinks, she ensured that every detail was flawlessly executed.

We chose the dinner menu with wine pairing, and it turned out to be an extraordinary culinary journey. Each course showcased a distinct theme, artfully matched with complementary flavors and textures. The experience began with a delicate Japanese sake accompanying the first course, setting a refined and elegant tone. From there, a well-paced progression of dishes was paired with carefully selected whites, reds, and a luscious dessert wine. Each pairing elevated the flavors, adding depth and nuance that transformed the meal into a beautifully curated tasting adventure.

This captivating experience unfolded over approximately 3.5 hours, and it was worth every minute, an indulgent celebration of taste, timing, and thoughtful presentation.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"
OCEAN Restaurant,Wen Fang,"I ordered the 4 course lunch menu and was blown away by the incredible food, service, and atmosphere.

I can't applaud the staff enough on how professional and friendly they were. I had the lovely May explaining each dish to me and making sure everything was going ok. There was also a group of diners at the table next to me making a lot of noise and crowding the tank to take selfies, so the staff kindly shifted them to the other end of the restaurant to allow me to enjoy observing the fish in the tank in peace - I was blown away by their kindness and consideration!

I was impressed with each course that came out. In addition to the menu items, there were also several complimentary hors d'oeuvres and desserts.

Each dish was expertly cooked, and each ingredient was extremely high quality and treated with utmost respect. As I had arrived at the restaurant just after it opened, I was shown a smoked duck neck the chefs had prepared for one of the hors d'oeuvres, as part of the restaurant's ethos to minimise wastage.

The Hokkaido scallop was large, plump, sweet, and had a buttery texture. The morello mushrooms had an amazing umami flavour and juicy beefy texture, I could have easily eaten a whole bowl of these. The white asparagus was tender and sweet, with no fibrousness at all. The sauces were also packed with flavour and complimented the dish wonderfully. A faultless dish!

The turbot was fall apart tender, as was the cabbage. The sauce also packed a lot of umami flavour which helped bring out the seafood flavour of the fish. The pickled shallots provided an acidity needed to balance the dish, and the tobiko provided some nice crunch as well to contrast the with the softness of the fish and cabbage.

The magret was cooked excellently, the fat had been rendered from the skin and the meat was blushing pink. I really enjoyed the toasted hazelnut garnish on the magret. The grilled orange provided a nice sweetness to combat the bitterness from the endive - which was cooked until it had a lovely soft texture. The only thing I noted was the toasted coriander seeds on top of the magret were a little bit too chunky, but I can imagine it would complement the magret nicely if it was ground down a bit more finely.

The dessert was very nice as well, the passionfruit jelly was very bright on the palette and packed with flavour. The pavlova was crisp and light, and the coconut jelly provided a good creaminess, along with the cream filling of the pavlova. The crispy rice was light and indeed crunchy, and had been coated in caramelised sugar which provided the slight bitterness needed to counteract the sweetness from the rest of the dish. I loved the addition of the lime zest sprinkled over the top of the dish. The only thing I noted was that the flavour of the mango sorbet was a little too subtle.

The complimentary bread was another unexpected highlight. I especially enjoyed the brioche and comte cheese bread. The brioche was crisp on the outside but light, fluffy, and buttery on the outside - i've never had anything like it before! The flavour of the comte cheese bread shone when eaten with the butter and honey.

The hazelnut dessert was also very delicious, the pastry tasted like a choux bun and it had a light chocolate/hazelnut creme filling inside which left a very clean mouthfeel afterwards.

Overall i'm very impressed with this restaurant and hope to come back the next time i'm in Singapore!

OCEAN Restaurant,Darc Kuang,"I rolled into Ocean Restaurant excited for an eight-course tasting and it was a real rollercoaster.

Food

The seafood all felt par-boiled rather than wok-seared, so if you’re after that big, smoky Asian punch, you might leave a little underwhelmed.

Most of the sauces were spot-on (I’m still dreaming of that miso-ginger), but the pea purée? One taste and my tongue threw in the towel. 😰

Apple crumble dessert: Cute concept, but they cranked the apple flavor so high it drowned out everything else.

Ambience

Mid-meal, it felt like an untightened tap dripped straight onto my wife’s dress—definitely not what you pay for in “elegant dining.” (air con)

A squad of drain flies crashed our party, buzzing around and even landing in the bread basket. Even after they tried to shoo them off, our little guests refused to leave.

Service
Huge props to service staff May for saving the night:

Table Rescue – Spotted the leak and moved us to drier ground.

Dish Hype – Walked us through each course like a personal hype squad.

Photo Assist – Snapped our shots so we didn’t end up looking like lost tourists.

Would I go back?
Maybe—but only if service staff May is on shift, they swap out that pea purée, dial down the apple in the crumble, and banish the flies.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"

OCEAN Restaurant,Iron Mac,"We had an unforgettable dining experience while celebrating our anniversary at Ocean Restaurant.

The ambiance was stunning and opulent, but what truly made our dining experience special was the incredible staff. Rona went above and beyond to make us feel celebrated, and Jackie was attentive, warm, and offered thoughtful recommendations that enhanced our meal. The sommelier, Marcus, and Jessica, were all very friendly. They added personalized touches that made our celebration even more extraordinary. Jessica even arranged our buggy ride and ensured everything went smoothly. The team made sure everything was perfect—kudos to them for their outstanding service!

As a food critic might say, the dishes were not your typical fare but offered a unique and creative twist. The flavors were well-balanced and delicious, making the experience both adventurous and enjoyable.

One of the most magical aspects was dining beside the massive aquarium, filled with fascinating marine life. Watching the graceful movements of the sea creatures while enjoying our meal was truly spectacular—it felt like being immersed in an underwater paradise.

The majestic atmosphere, paired with delicious food and outstanding service, made our anniversary celebration impeccable. We couldn’t have asked for a better one!

OCEAN Restaurant,Desmond Toh,"As a seafood lover and aquarium enthusiast, I had been looking forward to this experience after CATCORA more than 10 years ago.

The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was captivated by the stunning panoramic view of the S.E.A. Aquarium. Watching the marine life swim gracefully while enjoying my meal was truly mesmerizing.

We ordered a 8-course dinner set(288$) with wine pairing(+198).

While the restaurant undoubtedly boasts some of the freshest seafood in Singapore, excessive use of squid ink sauces might not be ideal for a first date.

The deep, inky hue can leave your lips and teeth stained, making it a less-than-romantic affair.
However, if you're willing to overlook the potential cosmetic mishap, the seafood itself is truly exceptional.

The freshness is a testament to the restaurant's commitment to sourcing the finest ingredients and showcasing them in their natural state. It seems the head chef also has some sort of special obsession with the use of foams with it on several dishes.

Service was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. He was attentive and ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.

Overall, my dinner at Ocean Restaurant was pleasant. I do recommend it to anyone with a budget to try this place when visiting Singapore or for a special occasion(just not first few dates).",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"
OCEAN Restaurant,Sky Chia,"Bought my wife for the anniversary lunch as she is from oversea. Reservation needs to be done at least a few months in advance as according to the serving staff there.

I did it like 3 weeks in advance due to an impromptu request from my wife to celebrate our anniversary. In additional we had also requested for any seat next to the fishes.

The location is a bit hard to find from the carpark to another carpark. And finally found the place.

We were set to a location where there was a super big pillar and yet paying the same pricing as the restaurant customers. The experience wasn't that great despite our advanced information being given to the restaurant. If only this carefully address to.

I think if the restaurant can pay ABIT attention and if the view wasn't available can keep us in the loop as leaving is an options to other restaurants and not with regrets.

Lastly we had to wait till 1 of the family tables had finished their meal then we requested to have our seats changed before the serving of the deserts.

Sincerely hope the restaurant can be upfront to any patron that visiting base on their request availability instead of only on sales on patrons which this is also too important to the revenue of the restaurant.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"

OCEAN Restaurant,Foo Cleo,"Dear Ocean Restaurant Team,

I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional experience my friends and I had during our recent visit. It was my second time at your restaurant, and I'm thrilled to report that the high standards we experienced during our first visit were not only maintained but exceeded.

A special mention goes to Laura, our server for the evening, who contributed significantly to our delightful experience. Her warm and cheerful demeanor, coupled with a quick sense of humor, added an extra layer of enjoyment to our night. Kudos to Laura for her excellent service!

The standout dish for me this time was the Octopus with chilled corn soup. The flavors were nothing short of extraordinary. The tenderness of the octopus was remarkable, almost as if it were still alive. The chilled corn soup elevated the dish to a whole new level, creating a festive atmosphere that made it feel like Christmas was just around the corner. I must admit, the dish was so delectable that I found myself tempted to abandon etiquette and indulge in licking the plate clean.

I want to extend my gratitude for providing my guests and me with a wonderful and memorable evening. The experience surpassed our expectations and, in the words of my friends, was even better than a short trip. The combination of good food, engaging conversations, and the welcoming environment made our time truly relaxing and pleasing.

I eagerly anticipate my third visit and will be following closely to see what new delights your menu has to offer.

OCEAN Restaurant,Addison Chen,"First I want let everyone know in case they also have trouble finding the restaurant!

Directions: We were coming from the aquarium and Google maps was telling us to walk through a construction that was still occurring for the Ocean Restaurant - turns out it was just them working on expanding their large aquarium. What I learn was that you need to be in the Equarius Hotel either by shuttle bus or walking there. Make sure you head to the parking lot because that is where the restaurant is located. You can take the escalator down to there or go through from the parking Lot.

Service: the host and staff were very accommodating and nice! They were going to have someone drive us to the pick up area via golf cart after our meal. They also gave us water and the AC in the restaurant was amazing after running a few miles to get to our reservation.

Food: this was a set menu so only had to make a decision on the appetizer and entree. The food was beautifully put together and every flavor was exploding. The food and the view of all the fishes was a truly unique excitement.

overall: If you want a unique experience and an amazing dining experience.

OCEAN Restaurant,Eunice Chan,"I am writing to express my frustration regarding my recent visit to your establishment. The service we received was unacceptable and significantly marred our experience.

First, the abrupt change to the menu was neither communicated in advance nor handled properly, which left us feeling unprepared and disappointed. Additionally, we were pressured to order items we clearly indicated we could not eat, specifically beef, which felt intrusive and disrespectful.

Furthermore, I noticed a concerning disparity in treatment from the lady I believe to be the manager. Her demeanor toward us was noticeably less respectful than that afforded to other tables, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere.

Finally, the overall management of the restaurant seems lacking. Our experience this time was inconsistent with the positive visits we've had in the past. While I acknowledge that the service staff were generally okay, this did little to mitigate the overall disappointment.

The food was absolutely delicious, we couldn’t fault any of it, the fish in the aquarium were such a fantastic addition. Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed by getting to the front of the aquarium and told we had to walk over a kilometre through a hot car park to access the entrance of the restaurant. My mother is 70 and was already struggling with the heat on Sentosa, I booked this extremely expensive treat for her 70th Birthday and for the price of $500 Australian dollars for the cheapest 4 course option they should at least have a lift inside the aquarium to access the restaurant.

OCEAN Restaurant,Klaus W.,"Firstly A few words about directions:
If you’re driving, be sure to read the access instructions carefully. The restaurant’s entrance is discreetly tucked away within the Resorts World Sentosa Car Park, which can be a bit tricky to locate if you’re unfamiliar with the area. For those using a ride-hailing service, it’s wise to bring a printed copy of the directions from your confirmation email, I assume many drivers, including ours, weren’t aware of this hidden gem.
As an added perk, the restaurant provides complimentary access to Sentosa Gateway, saving non-residents the usual entry fee.

Secondly once inside, everything unfolded seamlessly. From the moment we arrived, the evening blossomed into a truly delightful experience, The entire team was remarkably attentive and genuinely welcoming. A special shoutout goes to Rona, who orchestrated the evening with effortless grace and precision. From the impeccable timing of each dish to the harmonious pairing of drinks, she ensured that every detail was flawlessly executed.

We chose the dinner menu with wine pairing, and it turned out to be an extraordinary culinary journey. Each course showcased a distinct theme, artfully matched with complementary flavors and textures. The experience began with a delicate Japanese sake accompanying the first course, setting a refined and elegant tone. From there, a well-paced progression of dishes was paired with carefully selected whites, reds, and a luscious dessert wine. Each pairing elevated the flavors, adding depth and nuance that transformed the meal into a beautifully curated tasting adventure.

This captivating experience unfolded over approximately 3.5 hours, and it was worth every minute, an indulgent celebration of taste, timing, and thoughtful presentation.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m13!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m8!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!9m1!1b1!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"
OCEAN Restaurant,Wen Fang,"I ordered the 4 course lunch menu and was blown away by the incredible food, service, and atmosphere.

I can't applaud the staff enough on how professional and friendly they were. I had the lovely May explaining each dish to me and making sure everything was going ok. There was also a group of diners at the table next to me making a lot of noise and crowding the tank to take selfies, so the staff kindly shifted them to the other end of the restaurant to allow me to enjoy observing the fish in the tank in peace - I was blown away by their kindness and consideration!

I was impressed with each course that came out. In addition to the menu items, there were also several complimentary hors d'oeuvres and desserts.

Each dish was expertly cooked, and each ingredient was extremely high quality and treated with utmost respect. As I had arrived at the restaurant just after it opened, I was shown a smoked duck neck the chefs had prepared for one of the hors d'oeuvres, as part of the restaurant's ethos to minimise wastage.

The Hokkaido scallop was large, plump, sweet, and had a buttery texture. The morello mushrooms had an amazing umami flavour and juicy beefy texture, I could have easily eaten a whole bowl of these. The white asparagus was tender and sweet, with no fibrousness at all. The sauces were also packed with flavour and complimented the dish wonderfully. A faultless dish!

The turbot was fall apart tender, as was the cabbage. The sauce also packed a lot of umami flavour which helped bring out the seafood flavour of the fish. The pickled shallots provided an acidity needed to balance the dish, and the tobiko provided some nice crunch as well to contrast the with the softness of the fish and cabbage.

The magret was cooked excellently, the fat had been rendered from the skin and the meat was blushing pink. I really enjoyed the toasted hazelnut garnish on the magret. The grilled orange provided a nice sweetness to combat the bitterness from the endive - which was cooked until it had a lovely soft texture. The only thing I noted was the toasted coriander seeds on top of the magret were a little bit too chunky, but I can imagine it would complement the magret nicely if it was ground down a bit more finely.

The dessert was very nice as well, the passionfruit jelly was very bright on the palette and packed with flavour. The pavlova was crisp and light, and the coconut jelly provided a good creaminess, along with the cream filling of the pavlova. The crispy rice was light and indeed crunchy, and had been coated in caramelised sugar which provided the slight bitterness needed to counteract the sweetness from the rest of the dish. I loved the addition of the lime zest sprinkled over the top of the dish. The only thing I noted was that the flavour of the mango sorbet was a little too subtle.

The complimentary bread was another unexpected highlight. I especially enjoyed the brioche and comte cheese bread. The brioche was crisp on the outside but light, fluffy, and buttery on the outside - i've never had anything like it before! The flavour of the comte cheese bread shone when eaten with the butter and honey.

The hazelnut dessert was also very delicious, the pastry tasted like a choux bun and it had a light chocolate/hazelnut creme filling inside which left a very clean mouthfeel afterwards.

Overall i'm very impressed with this restaurant and hope to come back the next time i'm in Singapore!

OCEAN Restaurant,Darc Kuang,"I rolled into Ocean Restaurant excited for an eight-course tasting and it was a real rollercoaster.

Food

The seafood all felt par-boiled rather than wok-seared, so if you’re after that big, smoky Asian punch, you might leave a little underwhelmed.

Most of the sauces were spot-on (I’m still dreaming of that miso-ginger), but the pea purée? One taste and my tongue threw in the towel. 😰

Apple crumble dessert: Cute concept, but they cranked the apple flavor so high it drowned out everything else.

Ambience

Mid-meal, it felt like an untightened tap dripped straight onto my wife’s dress—definitely not what you pay for in “elegant dining.” (air con)

A squad of drain flies crashed our party, buzzing around and even landing in the bread basket. Even after they tried to shoo them off, our little guests refused to leave.

Service
Huge props to service staff May for saving the night:

Table Rescue – Spotted the leak and moved us to drier ground.

Dish Hype – Walked us through each course like a personal hype squad.

Photo Assist – Snapped our shots so we didn’t end up looking like lost tourists.

Would I go back?
Maybe—but only if service staff May is on shift, they swap out that pea purée, dial down the apple in the crumble, and banish the flies.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m13!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m8!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!9m1!1b1!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"

OCEAN Restaurant,Desmond Toh,"As a seafood lover and aquarium enthusiast, I had been looking forward to this experience after CATCORA more than 10 years ago.

The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was captivated by the stunning panoramic view of the S.E.A. Aquarium. Watching the marine life swim gracefully while enjoying my meal was truly mesmerizing.

We ordered a 8-course dinner set(288$) with wine pairing(+198).

While the restaurant undoubtedly boasts some of the freshest seafood in Singapore, excessive use of squid ink sauces might not be ideal for a first date.

The deep, inky hue can leave your lips and teeth stained, making it a less-than-romantic affair.
However, if you're willing to overlook the potential cosmetic mishap, the seafood itself is truly exceptional.

The freshness is a testament to the restaurant's commitment to sourcing the finest ingredients and showcasing them in their natural state. It seems the head chef also has some sort of special obsession with the use of foams with it on several dishes.

Service was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. He was attentive and ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.

I did it like 3 weeks in advance due to an impromptu request from my wife to celebrate our anniversary. In additional we had also requested for any seat next to the fishes.

The location is a bit hard to find from the carpark to another carpark. And finally found the place.

We were set to a location where there was a super big pillar and yet paying the same pricing as the restaurant customers. The experience wasn't that great despite our advanced information being given to the restaurant. If only this carefully address to.

I think if the restaurant can pay ABIT attention and if the view wasn't available can keep us in the loop as leaving is an options to other restaurants and not with regrets.

Lastly we had to wait till 1 of the family tables had finished their meal then we requested to have our seats changed before the serving of the deserts.

OCEAN Restaurant,Foo Cleo,"Dear Ocean Restaurant Team,

I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional experience my friends and I had during our recent visit. It was my second time at your restaurant, and I'm thrilled to report that the high standards we experienced during our first visit were not only maintained but exceeded.

A special mention goes to Laura, our server for the evening, who contributed significantly to our delightful experience. Her warm and cheerful demeanor, coupled with a quick sense of humor, added an extra layer of enjoyment to our night. Kudos to Laura for her excellent service!

The standout dish for me this time was the Octopus with chilled corn soup. The flavors were nothing short of extraordinary. The tenderness of the octopus was remarkable, almost as if it were still alive. The chilled corn soup elevated the dish to a whole new level, creating a festive atmosphere that made it feel like Christmas was just around the corner. I must admit, the dish was so delectable that I found myself tempted to abandon etiquette and indulge in licking the plate clean.

I want to extend my gratitude for providing my guests and me with a wonderful and memorable evening. The experience surpassed our expectations and, in the words of my friends, was even better than a short trip. The combination of good food, engaging conversations, and the welcoming environment made our time truly relaxing and pleasing.

I eagerly anticipate my third visit and will be following closely to see what new delights your menu has to offer. Thank you once again for creating such a special and enjoyable atmosphere for us.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/OCEAN+Restaurant/@1.2573295,103.7809638,14z/data=!4m13!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m8!1s0x31da1bfdc41d2a27:0x8f3d8dff2bfa0bbf!8m2!3d1.2573295!4d103.8170127!9m1!1b1!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSdk1WQjZSbHAzRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKgCEEs!16s%2Fg%2F1q69kqfrh"

OCEAN Restaurant,Eunice Chan,"I am writing to express my frustration regarding my recent visit to your establishment. The service we received was unacceptable and significantly marred our experience.

First, the abrupt change to the menu was neither communicated in advance nor handled properly, which left us feeling unprepared and disappointed. Additionally, we were pressured to order items we clearly indicated we could not eat, specifically beef, which felt intrusive and disrespectful.

Furthermore, I noticed a concerning disparity in treatment from the lady I believe to be the manager. Her demeanor toward us was noticeably less respectful than that afforded to other tables, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere.

Finally, the overall management of the restaurant seems lacking. Our experience this time was inconsistent with the positive visits we've had in the past. While I acknowledge that the service staff were generally okay, this did little to mitigate the overall disappointment.

OCEAN Restaurant,Addison Chen,"First I want let everyone know in case they also have trouble finding the restaurant!

Directions: We were coming from the aquarium and Google maps was telling us to walk through a construction that was still occurring for the Ocean Restaurant - turns out it was just them working on expanding their large aquarium. What I learn was that you need to be in the Equarius Hotel either by shuttle bus or walking there. Make sure you head to the parking lot because that is where the restaurant is located. You can take the escalator down to there or go through from the parking Lot.

Service: the host and staff were very accommodating and nice! They were going to have someone drive us to the pick up area via golf cart after our meal. They also gave us water and the AC in the restaurant was amazing after running a few miles to get to our reservation.

Food: this was a set menu so only had to make a decision on the appetizer and entree. The food was beautifully put together and every flavor was exploding. The food and the view of all the fishes was a truly unique excitement.

Lazy Lizard Sixth Avenue,Lorisa Chan,"We brought our friend here to have drinks at Lazy Lizard and celebrate a birthday. Evidently we brought our own cake cuz it's a bar right?
The waitresses did not even bother to offer us plates after we cut our cake. So my friends took their own initiative to use tissues. Luckily I brought plates. I asked the waitress if we can get plates from the bar, she said she didn't want to give us plates anymore as she saw we had our own and that they don't offer plates unless we gave the waitresses cake too. Trying to be environmentally friendly, we tried not to use our styrofoam plates but LITERALLY the waitresses gave us NO CHOICE.

Then one waitress asked us if we needed forks. Hello, was I suppose to eat the cheesecake with my hands? Luckily I prepared my cutlery.

Lazy Lizard Sixth Avenue,Lorisa Chan,"We brought our friend here to have drinks at Lazy Lizard and celebrate a birthday. Evidently we brought our own cake cuz it's a bar right?
The waitresses did not even bother to offer us plates after we cut our cake. So my friends took their own initiative to use tissues. Luckily I brought plates. I asked the waitress if we can get plates from the bar, she said she didn't want to give us plates anymore as she saw we had our own and that they don't offer plates unless we gave the waitresses cake too. Trying to be environmentally friendly, we tried not to use our styrofoam plates but LITERALLY the waitresses gave us NO CHOICE.

Then one waitress asked us if we needed forks. Hello, was I suppose to eat the cheesecake with my hands? Luckily I prepared my cutlery.

Other times they will add random skewers and insist on us paying as well. Won’t let you leave if you don’t pay.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Shermaine Tan,"Would say that this is a place to head to if you have a big family looking for affordable options that can feed big appetites!

The portions were generous, even the rice bowls would come overflowing with rice! The dishes were all well priced given that the quantity of meat in every dish is really big, just look at the photos of the dishes! Compared to most tze char places out there, they definitely do not skim on the servings here!

Also, each dish was flavourful with a lot of wok hey taste. However, just note that delicious food tend to be more on the unhealthy side so I would say the flavours also come from the generous amount of oil. Regardless, if you’re rating high on the taste side, this place definitely does a great job 👏

Our recommended dishes here include the beef (beef slices are always soooo tender), chicken in kungpao sauce, tomato egg and the tofu (generous servings of spinach under the tofu not pictured).

Service is generally ok, more of a casual dining style. The servers are rather attentive so not to worry about wanting to add on more orders. Drinks are self service which was quite interesting and fuss free.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Isaac Ong,"Affordable and tasty zhi char food in an air-conditioned space. $6 per plate. Service was relatively attentive and food was served quickly.

The restaurant is located at the stretch of restaurants right behind NUS so its a popular makan spot for students. Customers use an iPad per table to order and the ordering system is very easy to use.

The menu has alot of food options. We ordered Sweet & Sour Pork Rice with an added egg and a Seafood Hor Fun. Sweet and Sour Pork Rice was really yummy. Pork pieces were freshly fried and crispy, the sauce was tasty and the egg was fried perfectly with the egg white and yolk both being runny and soft while its sides were crispy. Rice was nicely cooked and complemented the pork well. The Hor Fun was generously supplied with seafood - every spoonful would come with a piece of seafood. Cooked well with wok hey taste and the noodles were thinner and usual, making it easier to bite and the noodles were well coated and cooked evenly.

There are plenty of drink options as well. DIY from the fridges and comes with chilled cup. No ice provided. They have a good selection of beer also (incl China beer that goes well with their grilled skewers).

Overall, the food is well cooked, tasty, affordable. Would definitely visit again.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Shirlene Tan,"First of all, service attitude was very poor and extremely disappointing. Not that we were expecting a high class service or anything, but the counter staff had a very unpleasant disposition when we walked into the restaurant and did not bother to acknowledge us or even look at us in the eye.

During the ordering process, she sent the wrong order to the kitchen as we only ordered 2 skewers - 1 mantou, 1 pork with enoki mushroom (see attached photo.) She simply insisted that we ordered 2 of the pork & enoki mushroom skewers but we only ordered 1. Even after we explained to her she still gave us bad attitude and we had to clarify once again. Then, she reluctantly changed our order.

That was not all. After receiving our food, we were shocked and astonished at the disastrous quality of the food (see attached photo.) We have eaten skewers elsewhere before and we know what to expect from a typical Chinese restaurant, and this certainly is way below the bar. The mantou (bread) is not even fried properly and does not have any taste, while the pork & enoki mushroom skewer was pathetically small and unappetising and of course no taste as well just salt.

Although we only made a small order, but don't we still have customer rights and deserve the basic respect?

Waiter (short haired female) was caught by me dropping a skewer into the dustbin and she stared at me for a moment but yet she placed it back onto the plate before serving it to her customers. When it came to my plate of skewers, she used a used plate which somebody else ate off from to count the sticks. Absolutely 0 sense of hygiene amidst this pandemic. All happened in the same visit btw! Probably not the first time and definitely not the last. One thing for sure it’s the last time for me there! Also heard a story of her giving my friend a used fork and she claimed it was cause of the sauce of the dish when my friends evidently saw her taking it out from the used pile! Outrageous

Also, they have a tendency to screw up your orders and double it and she’ll argue with you that you ordered 2 sets of everything. Worst service I’ve ever come across.

UPDATE: Heres a pic from an unknown source that is after this incident. The owner claims that the worker has been fired but she was still spotted and the same old trashy hygiene is back.

This is the worst service i have ever encountered in a restaurant in Singapore.

iPad order interface is difficult to understand, but staff was very reluctant to assist.

Staff threw the iPad back onto my table and rolled her eyes when I told her that I wasn’t done ordering after her initial assistance.

Wanted to order some drinks, but staff said just go get it myself from the fridge as that’s what everyone is doing.

Sought assistance from another staff (total of 2 attending to customers as the rest are all cooking in the kitchen) but was rudely instructed to refer to the other staff for help.

Ordered skewers but the amount was short of what we asked for (8 came instead of 10).  Although they did top it up for us it makes me wonder how they got it wrong as it was not even a massive order.

Towards the end of our dinner, heard the first staff chasing 2 tables of customers away the moment they finished their food as there were others waiting to eat.  Although it is understandable that customers should not linger during peak hours, the tone and attitude was really undesirable.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Shermaine Tan,"Would say that this is a place to head to if you have a big family looking for affordable options that can feed big appetites!

The portions were generous, even the rice bowls would come overflowing with rice! The dishes were all well priced given that the quantity of meat in every dish is really big, just look at the photos of the dishes! Compared to most tze char places out there, they definitely do not skim on the servings here!

Also, each dish was flavourful with a lot of wok hey taste. However, just note that delicious food tend to be more on the unhealthy side so I would say the flavours also come from the generous amount of oil. Regardless, if you’re rating high on the taste side, this place definitely does a great job 👏

Our recommended dishes here include the beef (beef slices are always soooo tender), chicken in kungpao sauce, tomato egg and the tofu (generous servings of spinach under the tofu not pictured).

Service is generally ok, more of a casual dining style. The servers are rather attentive so not to worry about wanting to add on more orders. Drinks are self service which was quite interesting and fuss free.

All in all, love this place!

Not that we were expecting a high class service or anything, but the counter staff had a very unpleasant disposition when we walked into the restaurant and did not bother to acknowledge us or even look at us in the eye.

During the ordering process, she sent the wrong order to the kitchen as we only ordered 2 skewers - 1 mantou, 1 pork with enoki mushroom (see attached photo.) She simply insisted that we ordered 2 of the pork & enoki mushroom skewers but we only ordered 1. Even after we explained to her she still gave us bad attitude and we had to clarify once again. Then, she reluctantly changed our order.

That was not all. After receiving our food, we were shocked and astonished at the disastrous quality of the food (see attached photo.) We have eaten skewers elsewhere before and we know what to expect from a typical Chinese restaurant, and this certainly is way below the bar. The mantou (bread) is not even fried properly and does not have any taste, while the pork & enoki mushroom skewer was pathetically small and unappetising and of course no taste as well just salt.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Isaac Ong,"Affordable and tasty zhi char food in an air-conditioned space. $6 per plate. Service was relatively attentive and food was served quickly.

The restaurant is located at the stretch of restaurants right behind NUS so its a popular makan spot for students. Customers use an iPad per table to order and the ordering system is very easy to use.

The menu has alot of food options. We ordered Sweet & Sour Pork Rice with an added egg and a Seafood Hor Fun. Sweet and Sour Pork Rice was really yummy. Pork pieces were freshly fried and crispy, the sauce was tasty and the egg was fried perfectly with the egg white and yolk both being runny and soft while its sides were crispy. Rice was nicely cooked and complemented the pork well. The Hor Fun was generously supplied with seafood - every spoonful would come with a piece of seafood. Cooked well with wok hey taste and the noodles were thinner and usual, making it easier to bite and the noodles were well coated and cooked evenly.

There are plenty of drink options as well. DIY from the fridges and comes with chilled cup. No ice provided. They have a good selection of beer also (incl China beer that goes well with their grilled skewers).

Overall, the food is well cooked, tasty, affordable. Would definitely visit again.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Dylan Lee,"Horrible experience at this place.
Waiter (short haired female) was caught by me dropping a skewer into the dustbin and she stared at me for a moment but yet she placed it back onto the plate before serving it to her customers. When it came to my plate of skewers, she used a used plate which somebody else ate off from to count the sticks. Absolutely 0 sense of hygiene amidst this pandemic. All happened in the same visit btw! Probably not the first time and definitely not the last. One thing for sure it’s the last time for me there! Also heard a story of her giving my friend a used fork and she claimed it was cause of the sauce of the dish when my friends evidently saw her taking it out from the used pile! Outrageous

Also, they have a tendency to screw up your orders and double it and she’ll argue with you that you ordered 2 sets of everything. Worst service I’ve ever come across.

UPDATE: Heres a pic from an unknown source that is after this incident. The owner claims that the worker has been fired but she was still spotted and the same old trashy hygiene is back. Plates are still being reused evidently from the picture.

This is the worst service i have ever encountered in a restaurant in Singapore.

iPad order interface is difficult to understand, but staff was very reluctant to assist.

Staff threw the iPad back onto my table and rolled her eyes when I told her that I wasn’t done ordering after her initial assistance.

Wanted to order some drinks, but staff said just go get it myself from the fridge as that’s what everyone is doing.

Sought assistance from another staff (total of 2 attending to customers as the rest are all cooking in the kitchen) but was rudely instructed to refer to the other staff for help.

Ordered skewers but the amount was short of what we asked for (8 came instead of 10).  Although they did top it up for us it makes me wonder how they got it wrong as it was not even a massive order.

Towards the end of our dinner, heard the first staff chasing 2 tables of customers away the moment they finished their food as there were others waiting to eat.  Although it is understandable that customers should not linger during peak hours, the tone and attitude was really undesirable.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Sabrina Tang,"Uncooked food and misleading. Terrible, horrible experience. Would have given 0 stars if possible.

Drunken chicken (~$10++) was overcooked, meat texture is like a few days old or boiled in soup before, small portion and hot (its supposed to be a cold dish). Sauce had no taste of alcohol at all. I have tasted several qualities of drunken chicken before and this is definitely 100% NOT drunken chicken.

When we approached the waitress and waiter to clarify about the food, they insisted that the drunken chicken was in fact drunken chicken. Refused to change. Refused to refund too. Waitress offered to get the chef out to clarify but he never came out.

BBQ scallop ($5++ each) was raw and undercooked. Potential food poisoning hazard. NEA, please note. My cousin, who is pregnant, was about to eat the entire scallop but her mother noticed that the scallop was undercooked. The implications of eating raw uncooked frozen seafood during pregnancy is dire.

Regarding the scallop, they refused to give a new one and only gave the option of re-heating the scallop they served. Talk about customer service.

Restaurant name is 香港小厨 (hong kong kitchen) but the dishes were not hong kong style but mainland chinese style. Totally misleading. But that aside, how could a restaurant serve such bad/low standard of food?

Will not go again.
