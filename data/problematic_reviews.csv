Saigon Legend @ West Coast Plaza,Mun Kew Leong,"First time at Saigon Legend. Seems to be a new restaurant. We were there at lunch time; no problem getting a table about 12nn but it filled up quite fast.

They have lots of lunch specials for a good price so my friend and I had one each, then shared an omelette as well. On weekdays they also gave us a glass of cold vietnamese tea for free.

My vermicelli special came with a spring roll, pork and raw vegetables to be mixed with the sauce and the vermicelli. I thought it was pretty good and the quantity was good for lunch. No flavour enhancers that I could taste; but lots of umami in the food. The omelette was well cooked, nicely browned but with a bit of runny egg in the middle. Worked well with the vermicelli!

Service was quick and the waitress was very patient with us (our first time) and explained all our questions. The tables are basic and it's pretty casual but the important part has to be the food.

I have received vouchers from my previous visit to this place before. But in my last visit, their cashier forgot to register the voucher, so we end up paying in full.

I‚Äôm not sure if it was the manager or boss who we managed to communicate this issue to, and she told us that we could use the voucher next time and would waived off the expiry on it.

Today, after visiting the outlet for a meal, they rejected our voucher. Saying it was expired.
We tried to explain the situation to the cashier, but she could not grasp the situation and called her boss. Which we then tried to explain again to the boss via the phone.

They still end up denying our vouchers.
At this point, we did not wanted to drag it further just for a $10 discount, so we paid in full and left.

Just felt utterly disappointed to frequent this place, only to experience the negligence by the staff, and then be given empty promises of being able to use the vouchers next time by whom I assume is the upper management.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saigon+Legend+@+West+Coast+Plaza/@1.3035473,103.6216819,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1af22a21450b:0xfbfa09120f288130!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da1b9258d57bf3:0xe15e92ee1a30d68a!8m2!3d1.3035473!4d103.7658775!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEVdmlldG5hbWVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgFEQ2k5RFFVbFJRVU52WkVOb2RIbGpSamx2VDJ0b2MyTkhjelJQV0dSdldrVm9TbEpIZUVWVVIzaHNUMVJXYm1GdVl4QUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABAw!16s%2Fg%2F11k41w1_0l"

Burnt Ends,Richard Lowe,"High expectations fall short
What we ordered:
Starters: Eggplant Miso; Beef Taco; Fennel, Orange and Burrata; Salt and Pepper Pork Ribs; Sourdough Bread.
Smaller servings, more like tasting plate size.

Best was Orange and Burrata, others were average to slightly below.

Mains: Flat Iron Steak
Nicely seasoned melt in the mouth steak, unfortunately had some foreign material in the salad which ruined the dish.

Deserts: Marshmallow, Flat White,  Soft Serve Cup
Interesting but Average flavours. The soft serve ice cream I would imagine it‚Äôs fairly hard to get wrong, but it was quite average tasting. Not sweet and flavours not full enough.

Drinks: Cucumber Smash, Mocktail Specials
Average, especially given the price they charge for the cocktails and Mocktails.
4 PAX lunch. Small servings, flavours of dishes a few hit and many misses.

The cocktails had a ridiculously massive square ice cube which meant there was actually very little to drink (see mocktail photo). The ice cube is from the bottom of glass to top. Literally 90% of the drink is this giant icecube.

We had a incident with foreign material (tissue / string) in our main flat iron steak meal, which ironically was the highlight best tasting of the entire menu we had. Highlighted this to the staff and kitchen, service recovery was a few complementary desserts which was about 7% discount of the entire bill.

The ice-cream wasn‚Äôt nice, the marshmallow had interesting flavours, not for everyone.

Candlenut,James Y,First time trying a strictly peranakan restaurant and it was quite impressive. The pork satay were very tender and flavorful and the crab curry had more crab meat than curry which is surprising to say the least.

Candlenut,Rui Yang How,"It has been my long-running wish to dine at Candlenut. Rather than feeling exquisitely modern like typical Michelin restaurants, Peranakan cuisine is typically cooked with thoughtful preparation and tastes like how your grandma(in SEA) would cook! Like most Asian cultures, it is best in a group of 4-5 so you can order multiple dishes a la carte. For couples, there‚Äôs still the ah-ma-kase!

Chef‚Äôs Mum‚Äôs Chicken Curry
One of the signature items in Candlenut, the curry is on the sweeter end and is very ‚Äòlemak‚Äô (aromatic) from the coconut milk. The chicken is not fall-off-the-bone but retains its texture while being easy peel off the bone. Get this with white rice!

Candlenut Buah Keluak Fried Rice
A must order signature dish! Buah Keluak is a nut that gives the fried rice a nutty profile (obviously). It is slightly spiced and has a surprisingly good wok hey to it. Make sure to break the yolk to give it an extra creaminess.

Cassava Kueh
Never ever skip dessert at Candlenut. Other than the signature Chendol, this kueh was really mind blowing.

Les Amis,onigiri,"Worst Michelin Restaurant Experience Ever

I went in expecting a three-Michelin-star standard, but it was an utter disappointment. Service was mediocre, and the food was simply bad.

The first dish‚Äîpasta with caviar and truffle‚Äîwas overwhelmingly sour. The acidity drowned out every other flavor; I could barely detect any truffle at all. The sourness lingered unpleasantly after each bite.

Then came another caviar dish. It felt like they were just sprinkling caviar on everything and calling it fine dining. Adding caviar to every plate doesn‚Äôt automatically make it Michelin-worthy.

The mushroom with cream was no better. The first thing I tasted was pure oil, followed by a faint mushroom chew. The cream in the middle was overpowering and clashed badly with the mushroom.

Overall, I can‚Äôt fathom how this place earned three Michelin stars. The taste was poor, and the menu seemed to revolve entirely around truffle and caviar‚Äîwithout any real finesse or balance.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Les+Amis/@1.3035473,103.6216819,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da198d12d2dbb1:0x341e29390026bcbd!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da198d6d839c47:0xb9387abec42c67e8!8m2!3d1.3066019!4d103.8314361!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEXaGF1dGVfZnJlbmNoX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUlpNMW8yVjNaM1JSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIcRBM!16s%2Fg%2F11g7z094p7"

Restaurant Fiz,Avijeet Sen,"Visited in Mar 2025

A visit to Fiz had long been in my cards. The dining experience at Fiz is really good, with food and service, both being top notch. The restaurant‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern‚Äù take on Malaysian/Southeast Asian cuisine whilst retaining traditional flavour profiles deserves appreciation. The courses are a mix of intricate and bold favour profiles which a treat to palates of diners who like Southeast Asian food. Among the starting courses, the heirloom carrots was my favourite course. The Nasi Dagang main course was absolutely fantastic too.

For drinks I went with the non-alcoholic pairing which was basically 3 Kombuchas. I believe there is also wine pairing for those interested.

Service was super good with Chef Hafizzul himself serving some of the dishes.

A definite recommendation for those willing to try a unique take on our region‚Äôs food/cuisine.

Restaurant Fiz,Ridza S.,"After abstaining from dining out for several months due to a medical procedure, I had a delightful weekend lunch experience at Restaurant Fiz recently.

Malay/Indonesian cuisine, with its generous use of herbs and spices, can be overpowering at times. But Restaurant Fiz did extremely well in mixing Southeast Asian ingredients to produce a remarkable and balanced taste and flavour. The food was a feast for my tastebuds, and I left the restaurant wondering the herbs and spices used in each course. In any case, as I only tried the four-course Sajian Pilihan lunch menu, I am making plans to be back for the Sajian Warisan dinner very soon!

The kari puff pusar (as a Singaporean Malay, I'm used to calling it epok-epok pusar, heh) was a nice, fiery introduction of what was to come. The tiger prawn with heirloom tomato (tasted very fresh!) was really yummy with its sweet-tangy dressing. I had ikan pekasam for the very first time - fermentation is common in Malay dishes but they can be quite extreme, so I appreciated that the ikan pekasam (accompanied by a bowl of piping hot congee that had a nice mix of ulam) was thankfully relatively easy/balanced on the palate. Dessert was so good - the Kuih Jiwa Melayang looked so deceivingly simple, but the mix of glutinous rice, ice cream and coconut custard was a nice way to end the meal.

I appreciated the attentive service. I had dietary requirements, and a team member phoned me prior to explain the menu in full. When I had to visit the restroom (I am on crutches), a member of the staff stopped what she was doing and led the way to the restroom. (On a side note, my friends loved the soap products in the restroom.)

Chef Hafizzul Hashim was very hands-on and involved in directing the kitchen. Chef came by our table a couple of times, including to explain the main course. When we exited the restaurant, he also came over to walk us out. Warm and hospitable gesture, as if we were visiting someone‚Äôs home.

Wonderful interior, with thoughtful layout and tasteful furniture and design. Well-maintained as to be expected. The restaurant floor had two rows of dining areas flanked by an island - so it was easy on the eyes and to get around. I also enjoyed the playlist, featuring Malay icons such as filmmaker-actor-musician P Ramlee and keroncong queen Katrina Dahari.

I think Chef Hafizzul did extremely well in challenging and imagining what Malay Fine Dining can be. (For one, I think we have to stop thinking or expecting an atas/elevated nasi padang or nasi campur experience!)

The moment I left the restaurant, I started texting my family and friends to encourage them to consider dining at Restaurant Fiz.

Restaurant Labyrinth,Adora,"A Personal Journey Through Singapore‚Äôs Past at Restaurant Labyrinth

Dinner at Restaurant Labyrinth wasn‚Äôt just a meal, it was a full-blown storybook of Singaporean flavors, flipped open and rewritten with imagination and pride.

Tucked inside Esplanade Mall, the space feels calm and intentional, no distractions, just you and the food. And the food? Bold. Playful. Rooted in heritage, but not afraid to break the rules.

We started with a prata topped with black winter truffle crispy, fragrant, and rich in a way that made me smile. It was the perfect opening act: familiar but dressed for the occasion. Then came the rojak, but not the one you expect. This version had 12 different local herbs, layered into a kind of botanical chaos that somehow worked. It was earthy, punchy, and deeply Singaporean.

One of the most memorable dishes was the crispy roast chicken rice, where the chicken wing was deboned and stuffed. Bite-sized nostalgia with precision cooking. The char kuey teow, meanwhile, featured ahk shellfish and Hokkaido scallops luxurious, smoky, and silky all at once.

Then there was chilli crab, but elevated made with local flower crab and paired with snow pear. It had heat, sweetness, and crunch like the original, but distilled to its essence. And the Bak Kut Teh? A revelation. Manjimup black truffle brought unexpected elegance to a soup I grew up with.

There was also a tribute to Cairnhill Steakhouse, ahk golden pomfret grilled beautifully and served with green asparagus. Simple, but perfectly done. And the Shashlik-style Angus short ribs? Cooked for 48 hours, fall-apart tender, and paired with an edible candle made of beef fat. Yes, really. It was theatrical, but grounded.

Dessert didn‚Äôt hold back either. Ice kachang came reimagined with ginger snow refreshing and nostalgic. And the final bite, a cereal prawn oatmeal soft serve, was the kind of cheeky local twist that makes you laugh and crave a second spoon.

Labyrinth doesn‚Äôt just serve food. It tells stories. Stories about childhood flavors, street stalls, and forgotten dishes, told through the lens of a chef who clearly reveres the past but isn‚Äôt afraid to remix it. It‚Äôs not traditional, and it‚Äôs not supposed to be. It‚Äôs Singapore, messy, proud, layered and I loved every bite of it.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restaurant+Labyrinth/@1.2796868,103.6998143,12z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da1972a345df8f:0xef84956ffe208514!8m2!3d1.2897489!4d103.8562976!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWc2luZ2Fwb3JlYW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOS09XSlhSRlZCRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQMw!16s%2Fg%2F1q5bnlpx4"

Whitegrass Restaurant,Jeffrey Chee,"After a sudden change of mind, I was looking for a place at Chijmes for lunch with my beau before attending the NDP preview and read a review about this restaurant. The person happened to be looking for a restaurant like me and was impressed. So I decided to dive in too and I'm glad I did. The ambience is cozy. The food was amazing. Apart from the occasional sourness, there was absolutely no chance to frown because each dish was so well presented and curated. And they did well to accommodate my special request for non-dairy servings without much discount in taste and presentation. I salute the chef. The crew were very professional.

Osteria Mozza,Chewielicious T,"Visited on a public holiday and learned the hard way that the 25% Hilton Honors discount doesn‚Äôt apply on eves or holidays‚Äîended up paying $110 for just three dishes, seated outside in the sweltering heat. Not ideal, but our fault for doing a walk in.

That said, the pizza was excellent‚Äîa perfect blend of Blue Label‚Äôs crispy base and D.O.C‚Äôs flavour. Easily a 10/10.

The fried potato dish was a confusing mess‚Äîcrispy bits over guacamole mush. Flavour, texture, and temperature all clashed. It honestly shouldn‚Äôt be on the menu.

The duck ragu was generous in duck and used fresh pasta, but tasted exactly as expected‚Äînothing memorable.

Restaurant JAG,Roger Lee,"I haven't eaten at many Michelin starred places, but I have eaten at a handful in Singapore London New York.  I think this is one of the best experiences and meals ever.

Ordered the 6 course menu at 298 nett and took vegetarian (as my partner is vegetarian).

The meal absolutely blew me away.  Every dish had a wow factor.

I did think dessert was slightly disappointing (good but not out of the ordinary) though even  their petit fours and a small passion fruit cake they gave for us celebrating an anniversary -- was splendid.

Chef had a beautiful story to explain his vision of using seasonal produce vegetables from France and why he also dedicated himself to a vegetarian menu, service was splendid and not intrusive.

I'm sure the food was cooked with a lot of technique and finesse. The explanation and the presentation never did seem too-over-complicated and yet lack the wow factor, which I had felt at some other fine dining.  Overall, I thought the food was just impeccable and wowwwww

The place, at first sparse and looked not that impressive for a Michelin starred restaurant, really started to take its form as the sun set and lights dimmed and more guests filled the space.

I didn't do alcohol as I was driving, but I had a lovely introduction to the Heaps Normal XPA beer Non-Alcoholic (it's actually 0.5% alcohol but technically qualified as non-alcoholic).  I'll be looking to purchase some to drink at home lol

I think everything was close to perfect-- of course there is no perfection-- but this is one experience not to miss.

Restaurant JAG,Audrey Khoo,"This was my second time dining at Jag, and unfortunately, it fell short in several ways. First visit was memorable.

We booked a private room for a large group gathering ‚Äî something we do every few months. We chose a private space so we could enjoy ourselves freely. To our surprise, a staff member came in mid-meal to tell us we were being too loud. That completely killed the mood. What‚Äôs the point of a private room if we‚Äôre still expected to stay quiet? We‚Äôve dined at many other high-end restaurants and never encountered this issue. Either the room is poorly designed for sound or the staff doesn‚Äôt understand the purpose of private dining.

Food-wise, it was hit or miss.

The saving graces:
The great company amongst friends.
‚Ä¢	Excellent cheese selection.
‚Ä¢	Dessert was the highlight ‚Äî hats off to the pastry chef for ending the night on a high note.

Restaurant JAG,Zoe Y,"We had an exceptional experience at JAG with their AUTUMN Menu. It‚Äôs rare to find a restaurant where vegetables are the star of the show, with proteins and sauces thoughtfully crafted to complement them. The menu featured unique vegetables not commonly found in Singapore, such as yacon, Jerusalem artichokes, and salsify. These introduced a wonderful array of flavors and textures, offering a truly distinctive dining experience. The pigeon was prepared in a way that made it feel more like steak than poultry, in terms of mouthfeel. The seabream dish with salsify was undoubtedly my favorite of the night.

Although the dinner was a 6-course meal, we were treated to an impressive array of appetizers and refreshers, bringing the total to about 14 dishes, depending on whether you opt for cheese or an aperitif. This was followed by a pre-dessert, dessert, and post-dessert. The dessert, featuring truffle ice cream (not the chocolate kind!), was an unforgettable experience. The fragrant truffle, typically paired with potatoes, was infused into the ice cream, perfectly complemented by chocolate ganache and cacao nibs ‚Äì an absolute journey of flavors.

The entire dining experience lasted nearly 3.5 hours, including an additional caviar experience. Be sure to allocate sufficient time for your visit, as this leisurely pace allows you to fully savor each dish without feeling rushed.

The staff were incredibly attentive throughout the evening, always quick to top up our water and explaining the intent behind each dish. They also made sure to check in and ensure we were enjoying the experience. What truly stood out was the chef, who personally visited each table not once, but twice, engaging with guests in a meaningful conversation about the menu and our experience ‚Äì not just a brief hello and goodbye.

As a thoughtful touch, we were sent off with two small bottles of their signature perfume, which had a lovely woody, earthy scent that was actually quite pleasant.

While some of the dishes featured ingredients that were new to me, I appreciated the creativity and boldness behind each one. Although personal preferences may have meant I wasn‚Äôt as fond of certain elements, I could still recognize the skill and thoughtfulness in every dish. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and look forward to returning to explore their ever-evolving seasonal menus.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restaurant+JAG/@1.2796868,103.6998143,12z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da1952073eff29:0x2d6764446a838a2a!8m2!3d1.2911018!4d103.8402617!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOaWQzTlBNalZCUlJBQqoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAh6EDo!16s%2Fg%2F11ff1ydx9z"

As for the main dishes, pls note that mee sua Èù¢Á∫ø is a thin liked spaghetti type noodles and not those thin oyster mee sua ones. Very generous with the noodles portion.

For the braised seafood noodles, all there was were 4 Lala, 3 spring small prawns and egg mixed and a few slices of fish cakes. Told boss it would be good if there were at least 2 meat slices. The Lala flesh was also missing and not in the shell. Overall it is not ex, but the ingredients were lacking.

Artichoke,Agnes Goh,Food is superb only down side is the bar table seating. We booked and pay deposit via credit card and told only can choose bar table. Most of the place bar table is fine as we can see the cooking station but this place we were seated facing the washing station. In the photo you can see chef cooking with their back facing us so practically we can‚Äôt see any cooking stuff except the washing part üò† we asked to shift table and they said only outdoor is applicable as that is for walk-in. You expect us to seat outdoors with the terrible humidity weather and don‚Äôt forget we paid for reservations with the extra effort of booking.

The dishes were fantastic - japanese fusion, the taste was exactly on point! Every dish was fantastically balanced and lovely. Plating was beautiful, modern and fun.
It was however a little harder to grasp the concept of the menu - we needed a little assistance. Likewise, when we asked for more info about some of our plates, we got incorrect information. Not a big issue though, we had a great experience.

When I had submitted the reservation, I had merely asked if I could send flowers to the venue and if the ring could be hidden in one of the dishes. What I didn‚Äôt expect was Ashleigh going way above and beyond: immediately reaching out and suggesting innovative ideas to consider. On the day of the engagement, she walked me through the entire process and it was clear that they wanted to facilitate as far as possible to make the day a success! She was also supported by Rohit and Net, who were extremely caring and as far as I recall, the best service staff team that I have ever experienced.

The food was also spectacular. First, they served us with a Parker Roll, which was extremely flavourful while being both soft and crisp. The daily selection of the butter was excellent too, a miso butter and a black olive butter ‚Äì it was so good that we held onto them throughout the whole service even after we finished the bread!

As for the mains, we had the White Miso Cod and the Duck Breast. The cod in particular was spectacular. Taste, texture and the sauce were on point ‚Äì in fact, probably among the best cods that I have had and it was really unique, bringing both the Western and Japanese sides together. The Duck was excellent too but I am someone who likes strong tasting meats - if that's not you, then perhaps another dish could work better!

For the dessert, we had the deconstructed black forest which was really unique, esp as they will prepare the dish at your table, explaining each of the deconstructed component! The quality of the ingredients were also top-notch and it was a great dish overall!

Super happy with my dinner at Camille and would strongly recommend for others to pay them a visit, especially if one is celebrating special occasions.

Interior was small and it can feel a bit claustrophobic. Furniture seemed old and rickety as well, but you could say they have true French character.

The French Ladle,Matt Ho,"Booked this place for a celebratory lunch with my partner and it delivered - packed a punch.

Came on a non-holiday Sunday, made reservation for 1245pm, which thankfully I did because it was otherwise full. Shared a 2-course ($32 nett) and 3-course ($38 nett) set between both of us.

Starters - Fig salad, seafood soup
- Great starters. Seafood was rich, and fig salad was just right to whet the appetite.

Mains: Duck Confit Aglio Olio, Pan Seared Barramundi
- Aglio Olio was al dente, and somehow had a (nice) slightly toasted taste? Duck meat was also tender and seasoned well
- Barramundi was the better dish for me, skin was crisped well and fish meat was just rightly cooked. The baked potatoes tho, was melty in my mouth. No chunks felt at all.

Dessert - Lemon Tart
- One of the best, most balanced lemon tart I've had in my life. Just the right amount of sour, zest, and natural sweetness from the fruit toppings. Pastry was well textured too.

The French Ladle,Elaine Low,"Nestled discreetly within a residential condo lies a culinary gem, a haven of delectable French cuisine that whisks you away from the tropical island vibes to the enchanting streets of France. From the moment you step inside, the cozy ambiance envelops you, setting the stage for a gastronomic journey like no other.

Each bite at this hidden gem is a revelation, a tantalizing glimpse into the culinary mastery of French cuisine. Take, for instance, the fig salad, a seasonal delight that bursts with freshness, awakening your taste buds with every forkful. It's like a symphony of flavors dancing on your palate, transporting you to a sun-kissed orchard in Provence.

And then there's the duck confit pasta, a dish that embodies the essence of French cooking with every twirl of the fork. The pasta oozes with richness and depth of flavor, courtesy of the tender duck confit, creating a harmonious melody of taste that lingers long after the last bite.

But let's not forget about the trout, a dish that's just as impressive in its simplicity as it is in its execution. Each flake of fish is perfectly cooked, delicate yet bursting with flavor, a testament to the chef's skill and attention to detail.

And then there are the beef cheeks, a true revelation for the senses. Tender, succulent, and bursting with flavor, they practically melt in your mouth, leaving you craving for more with each heavenly bite.

Of course, no French culinary experience would be complete without a taste of foie gras, and this hidden gem certainly doesn't disappoint.

Dempsey Hill,Amanda Tan,"Got the truffle mushroom pizza. Great for sharing! But to each 4 slices on your own would be difficult as the mushrooms are q overpowering. The aglio olio was DELICIOUS but q expensive for just aglio olio. The other seafood pasta wasn't as yummy but it's more value for money. Didn't like the BBQ pork ribs but maybe I'm just not a fan of BBQ sauce and pork ribs. My grandmother loved them tho. The squid ink risotto was not bad, nothing fantastic.

Drinks were really not value for money so we didn't get any üôÉ bill added up to $200+ for 5 people and also I got a free slice of bday cake (cuz my mom asked for some bday promo HAHA) which was really delicious btw. It was red velvet cake drizzled with some berry sauce. I'd pay for that.

Bacaro,Ken W,"It's a nice, quaint, authentic restaurant that serves quality food. We really liked all the dishes.

The meat balls were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The eggplant was well done but a bit more on the bland side. The beef and pork filling was very fragrant.

The Parma ham fried pizza was really good too. The crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The cheese was very tasty and the taste overall blended together very well.

The scallops were very tasty and fragrant.

The truffle risotto was delicious. The truffle was fresh and wasn't overpowering. The cheese was great too.

The carbonara was alright. It was served with pepper, which was interesting. The taste was good, but the pasta was a bit too hard for our liking.

The braised beef cheek was very delightful. It was crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. The taste wasn't overpowering as well.

The burrata and truffle was good too. The taste is perfect.

The beef tenderloin was a bit overcooked (we ordered medium rare but was served more like medium). But no complaints on the taste - the meat was well marinated.

We ordered three tiramisu - the espresso (which was our fav), rum (this was very good too, and the taste of rum was strong enough for our liking) and normal tiramisu (this was good but a bit more sweet compared to the rest)

Overall, a very good meal and the service was excellent. The pace at which the food was served was great too.

Chin Huat Live Seafood,Lois Amaral,"3.5 stars.  A 8 persons lunch for $1500+ table, so almost $200/person. Service was very good. Attentive and Friendly. Kudos to them! Food was so-so for the price. We came specifically for their suckling pig, and steam Alaskan crab (3.42kg), and also ordered their fried eggplant (delicious), steamed bamboo oyster/clam (this was good), alaskan crab bee Hoon (too dry) ,   spicy  kangkong (under-seasoned) and had very yummy desserts (coconut jelly, ornee, and mochi).  The star of the afternoon, for most of us were the mochi desserts.

The reason why the food was ranked 3 stars is because the main dishes that were supposed to steal the show, were disappointing, namely the suckling pig (the skin wasn't crispy enough and it's kinda gummy‚Äîlike they didn't render the fat out enough),  and the Alaskan crab that was prepared two ways (steamed and with bee hoon). The steam garlic one was enjoyable but the flavor was almost there but not even 90% there, and the alaskan crab beehoon while tasty, was too dry.  The sauce for the beehoon was really great, but it was just not enough for the beehoon at all, so we had chunks of dry beehoon.

You know, sometimes when you eat a dish, and you feel like the chef's heart wasn't in the cooking?  That's how we felt... or that it wasn't the executive chef who cooked for us.

We dined in one of their elegant VIP rooms, which has a minimum spend of $998 on weekdays (not sure about weekends), but it‚Äôs worth it for celebrations or family feasts.

Shashlik Restaurant,Janelle Yeo,"It's been years since we ate at Shashlik and wow the place has been beautifully renovated!!!! Cosy vibes. We especially like the ""history"" wall - such a good way to honour its beginnings and the people who worked there.

The üçû bread was a little denser than how I remembered it, but still yummy. The ribeye was SO GOOD though! Definitely much better than I recall! There's a good amount of marbling/fats in the ribeye (see photo) which made it so tasty! The ribeye is what a classic western steak should be. Many Western places can't do a classic western steak right, but Shashlik proved that they know how to do a classic steak well. It's everything we expect from a western styled steak on a hotplate.

Mushroom soup is on the creamier end with a generous portion. We'd recommend to share it between two people.

We didn't order their dessert because we were too full, but check out the video of the fancy dessert with FIRE. The orange zest smelt so good from where we were seated too.

Finally, the kids Mac & Cheese was legit + came with yakult. The white sauce they made was really good, and look at that cheese (see photo) ü§©. The adults liked the Mac & Cheese too. It's always appreciated when restaurants put as much love and thought into kid's meals, and it's not an after thought.

AND FINALLY, WE NEED TO RAVE ABOUT THEIR SERVICE. We find it so rare to get such nice, homey, authentic service these days in Singapore. The staff and Shashlik were all so attentive, WARM, and helpful. The lady who served us was so kind towards our son, and made our experience so much better. One of the staff who served us wore the original red vest - means he's one of the OGs! Such an honour to be served by this old uncle. We really get the sense that everyone who works here are here to really serve others - such wonderful hospitality and service. It's service like this that makes us keep coming back to Shashlik and telling our family and friends about them.

Encore by Rhubarb,Kai Yong,"Rhubarb's food was really great. We had lunch omakase.

We loved the main course, the meat was perfectly cooked with delicious mushrooms and sauces. The pork dumpling was great too.

The signature 'tiramisu' was good, but I felt that it did not necessarily achieve a good balance as the sourness of the mushrooms would overpower the other mild tastes. I also feel that a foam dish is not a worthwhile fourth course meal.

The opener cones were a great palette introduction!

The fish appetiser was perfect. The texture of the fish is really good, it had a smooth and chewy texture within due to the slight rawness. Loved it.

The desert could use a bit more mango and perhaps some additional flavours to manage the neutral taste of the coconut and dry ice.

Overall, food was great.

Service on the other hand was lacking. We had some last minute scares on not being able to make our reservation and tried calling to ask about cancelling and asked for a fee waiver. Although it was not a good thing on our side, I felt that the person on call wasn't very friendly and got agitated with the inquiry. In the end, we managed to make it.

When we were seated, the waitress asked a lot of questions. Firstly, she Asked if we were going to order liquor. We said not for now, so she proceeded to take the wine glasses. However, we were still interested to look at the wine menu so we held onto the menu. The waitress became annoyed and tried to still take the menu and asked us again if we actually wanted wine. We then said not now, but could we not look at the wine menu??? And the waitress just left.

Aside from that, I didn't like that there were another waiter and waitress frequently standing at the kitchen counter seemingly gossiping and staring at us a lot.

Also, when I asked the waiter for more bread or anything, he just smiled and went away to do it. I feel that for fine dining service, the waiter should try to give a response such as, ""sure of course"".

For the atmosphere, I loved the floral arrangements.

In overall, Rhubarb's food was good, but man I seriously recommend rhubarb to take a good look at themselves and especially their service, and ask themselves if they are actually worthy of a michelin star.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Encore+by+Rhubarb/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da196d66892a49:0xa556409c36f74a38!8m2!3d1.2793726!4d103.8430536!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERZnJlbmNoX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTnVhRjlFU0c1M1JSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIHxBG!16s%2Fg%2F11dymd6zhx"

Encore by Rhubarb,Mia Z,"Excellent meal! Enjoyed every bite! Attentive and pleasant service

Amuse bouche was nice but I think I was too excited about the rest of the meal so don't remember the details of how it tasted. Took the olive bread with a very creamy butter.

Oyster was amazing! Still thinking about it and wishing I could have it again. Perfectly balanced citrus, sweet, savoury notes :3

Soup was chestnut with mushrooms, very very nice. I never thought they would go well together but they did. Texture was like a mousse.

Scallop was good, but slightly plain in comparison to the preceding oyster. The lemongrass sauce didn't completely agree with my taste buds. Interesting flavours that I don't regret trying though.

Main was pork with a sausage dumpling thing on top. Pork was perfectly done, natural flavours of pork coming through well. The sausage dumpling thing was vaguely reminiscent of luncheon meat but nicer, and I'm not complaining about that!

Dessert was a pleasure to look at and taste. Various bits and types of chocolate with a strip of almond jelly.

Petite fours to end off the meal as well and they came in a very cute drawer box.

Great experience overall! Will return!

Nouri,You K,"Fine dining restaurants typically offer only set menus, usually consisting of 9 to 12 courses. Invariably, there tends to be one or two dishes that are difficult to understand in terms of flavor.
However, to my surprise, this restaurant did not have any such 'puzzle' dish; every course was exquisitely delicious with stunning presentations.

While we enjoyed pairing the dishes with sake, which featured an unusually unique selection, that is a story for another time. As a sake sommelier myself, I must commend the choice of brands.

Upon entering, there was almost a ritualistic hand-washing ceremony, and a moment during the course to select tea leaves, which I found to be a brilliant touch. It prevents any dull moments and reflects the staff's concerted effort to create a wonderful atmosphere.

Ce Soir Restaurant,HaHa HeHe,"Such a difficult review to write, evoking conflicting feelings till this day even though our visit was in Sep 2024. It was a birthday lunch treat from the wifey.

I'll start with the negatives. Space wise, while the dining room itself was adorned with beautiful flower arrangements, the lack of a proper entrance and the restaurant being situated almost in the middle of nowhere resulted in the lack of a sense of place. Upon arriving, we stood outside wondering if we were at the correct location, and upon entering, it was the dining room immediately. However, my biggest gripe was with the service. Despite being dressed in a shirt, bermudas, and Birkenstock sandals, I was promptly informed that I was apparently in ‚Äúshorts‚Äù and ‚Äúslippers‚Äù. Then, I was told that they would make an exception in accommodating us in a manner that we were being done a favour. Every dish was served without a glint of a smile and for some, without any explanation. Even when I gave a glowing feedback for one dish and described it as ‚Äòstunning‚Äô, all it drew was a muted ‚Äúthank you‚Äù with a tentative half-smile from the manager. At one point, I was so deep in thoughts savoring the food and unrealizingly dangled my sandal for a mere few seconds, and was swiftly told off by the manager. Though not defining per se, the chef greeted the other 2 tables but skipped ours completely, which felt like the icing on the cake. In short, I felt discriminated and utterly unwelcomed throughout the entire lunch service by the manager and server on duty.

Minor credit due: a complementary dessert was arranged for the celebratory occasion. Granted, I accept partial fault for not fully adhering to the dress code. Though quite frankly, in Singapore‚Äôs unbearably humid climate and for a lunch service, I did not feel my dressing alone warranted such treatment.

Such a pity: because the food was exceptional. I remarked that this was the best non-Michelin starred restaurant we‚Äôve been to in Singapore solely based on food.
-Amuse bouche (4.5/5) ‚Äì All 3 were packed with so much flavor ‚Äì albeit each in their different ways ‚Äì that left us wanting more.
-Burihira (3.5/5) ‚Äì Not bad and the acidity opened appetites but did not really stand out.
-Scallop Kakiage (3/5) ‚Äì This dish did not really work imo as the tempura coating for the scallop became soggy shortly after by the sauce which had a watery consistency. However, the taste was interesting, bold even, and still enjoyable overall.
-Nori Bread (5/5) ‚Äì So good, the bread, the butter, all of it. One of the best bread we had in Singapore, probably only behind or perhaps on par with Sommers parker house roll.
-Sakura Ebi Risotto (5/5) ‚Äì Without a doubt: the best dish. From the contrasting flavours of the ebi‚Äôs umaminess matched with the curry base infused with a hint of smokiness to the varying textures, it was a perfectly balanced dish pretty much in every aspect. This was the dish I described as ‚Äòstunning‚Äô.
-Duck and Wagyu (4/5): Tried options for the mains. The duck was expertly cooked. The accompanying sauces added an interesting touch as it wasn‚Äôt just the usual jus. Perhaps, the wagyu could have had better marbling. Delightful dishes.
-Blackberries (3/5) ‚Äì Nothing mind-blowing but a decent dessert that played on textures.
-Petit fours (3.5/5) ‚Äì Really nice bites, including the complementary celebratory ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù. Fitting end to the meal.

In sum, I chose to end on a positive note (the food) as it was that good, though unfortunately, the whole experience was marred by the service. Perhaps, the service might have already changed for the better and assuming the food level remains, it is definitely on par with 1* restaurants in Singapore we‚Äôve been privileged to visit. Also, the chef has a moving backstory at his previous stint which I chanced upon a couple of years back. Much support for such an inspiring young talent. With Singapore‚Äôs Michelin Guide Ceremony 2025 to take place later today evening, my personal experience aside, I hope the restaurant receives the accolades it deserves.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ce+Soir+Restaurant/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1a498475d6bf:0x601cb3d878462dda!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1b37b2d1790d:0x51c327160b9d1c88!8m2!3d1.2943592!4d103.7959978!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VONk5XVTJVMFJSRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECCAQQw!16s%2Fg%2F11ryljbnyn"
Ce Soir Restaurant,Valerie Yeo,"My third dining experience at Ce Soir with Chef Seth and his team and every visit was a gastronomic adventure. I had the chance to taste two different menus in the three visits and I loved every dish that was presented. So much attention to each ingredient and how it would balance with each of the sauces made by Chef from scratch. In the most recent visit, I enjoyed the Hokkaido scallop with Sarawak white pepper and Bouchot mussels so much! The white pepper elevated the taste of the Hokkaido scallop and together with the subtle flavours of the Bouchot mussels made a perfect balance to the dish!‚≠êÔ∏è Another favourite was the Lobster with smoked sherry butter! An amalgamation of the sauce and lobster brought out the umami-ness of the dishüëçüèª

Mott 32 Singapore, ç…æ…¥,"Actually I tried visiting here a few times before. But due to every single time not making reservation, there's no available tables.

This time, it was still an impromptu decision, to try again. As we were celebrating our anniversary, and also had a 8PM show at the Sands Theatre.

Initially the FOH staff (I'm sorry I forgot her name üòÖ) told us if we could accept a bar table seating, it'd be around 15 mins wait time. We were OK with it.

Thankfully, after 15 mins she told us there's a table available, as the diner was done with. We went ahead with it.

We were served by Kok Fong at the table.

It starts with choices of water. Between Sparkling & Still, We went with Sparkling. With Lime.

Kok Fong was spontaneous, great at convos, had a keen-eye, and great at engaging with customers.

We ordered a Barbecue Iberico Pork, Yellow Mountain Honey Char siu (ËúúÊ±ÅÈªëÊØõÁå™ÂèâÁÉß)($52). Kok Fong did explain to us that it was a 50-50 Fat-Lean ratio. Or we call it ÂçäËÇ•Áò¶. Which I like how he explained about it. I could taste the smokiness of the char siu, with the hint of the honey and it was marvelous.

We also ordered a Fish Maw, Conpoy, Garoupa soup (Ëä±ËÜ†Áë§Êü±ÈæçË∫âÁæπ)($25 each). Served with pepper on the side. It was thick, didn't have a strong fishy taste, but you can taste the essence of the collagen & the fish in the thick soup. Had strips of black fungus too. Delicious!

We also ordered a Shredded 42 Days Peking Duck Salad, beetroot, crispy taro, citrus truffle dressing (Âåó‰∫¨ÁÉ§È¥®Áµ≤Ê≤ôÊãâ)($24). Kok Fong even assisted us to give the salad a good mix. Thanks, KF! Salad was good. Had a hint of the truffle, but not too overpowering. Strips of duck weren't too thin & also had ice plants inside as well. Good starter. Airy. Crunchy.  But makes you a little full.

We also had an Alaskan crabmeat fried rice, flying fish roe (ËüπËÇâÈ£õÈ≠öÁ±ΩÁÇíÈ£Ø)($60). We were contemplating initially on either this, or the Yangzhou Fried Rice. But this has more customers ordering, yeah we went with this. Theres a substantial amount of crabmeat in the fried rice, and a good amount of roe. When having it together, the texture of the rice complements the roe well. Rice is Á≤íÁ≤íÂàÜÊòé too.  Good for sharing between 2-3 pax.

At this point we're a little too full for dessert. But the dessert menu looks good too. Guess we could only try it the next time.

There's a toilet inside as well. Which is very clean. Nobody really reviews this. But I feel the whole interior design, colour scheme, warm comfortable lighting play an important part of dining.

Overall, I liked the food & the service is remarkable. Recommended to make advance reservation.

Aside from that, the ladies from the Front of House also offered to help me store my backpack in the front as it was alittle big. Which made my dining experience better too.

Staff at the checkout area also asked if I was a Sands Member, and if I was driving.

Of course, these are probably SOPs, but, these also help elevate the dining experience the guests have. So, thank you again, for the Team @ Mott 32, on 26 July 2025, around 6pm.

Mott 32 Singapore,Yan,"Came here specifically for the Peking Duck after seeing all postive reviews.
The duck was freshly done and while waiting, the other dishes I had built up my expectations for the signature duck.

Fish maw soup with garoupa was so flavourful that i might just come here and order this with a bowl of rice and it would be a very satisfactory meal.
The crispy pork belly was sooo good, crispy, good balance of fat and lean meat and juicy,  a little bit of mustard adds a bit of tangyness which i quite like.
The egg tarts were worth the wait as well, frshly done, flaky and soft. The prawn dumplings were decent and not bad at all. The stir fried ee mian was also love at first bite, it was really well done!
The environment was nice, the service was also great, quick response and friendly staffs.

But, the signature dish was a huge letdown. i was expecting ÁâáÁöÆÈ∏≠Ôºåbut there was only 1 small plate of duck skin which was not as crispy as i hoped and dry, it felt like it was there in the oven for abit too long. It came with a plate of sugar to dip in, but it didnt help much. Other plates were huge cuts of duck meat that did not go well with the flour crepe served, it was hard to chew altogether. The meat is pretty good for a roast duck but not what i wanted for a Peking duck.

I would love to go back again for all the other dishes, but not the peking duck.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mott+32+Singapore/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19042c2b8e05:0x5bbfe00eea6eda8!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19db995822eb:0xd47a2b1bbbd4ff2d!8m2!3d1.2853092!4d103.8594145!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5xY2psbVFXRm5FQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQICBBJ!16s%2Fg%2F11h9pky_k9"

We ordered these:
-  Barbecued Iberico pork, with yellow mountain honey:  definitely our favorite - so tender and juicy. I will come back just for this

-  Steamed dim sum:  we like the king prawn har gaw, soft quail egg black truffle siu mai the most. The quail egg is half boiled filled inside the siew mai, very interesting

- Crispy prawn rice roll:  this is another item we always order. The prawn filling ÁÇ∏ÂÖ© inside the rice roll, gave 2 contrast layer of texture , sort and crispy in one bite

- Pan fried turnip cake: very simple recipe, but the turnip cake was pan fried to the optimal temperature, crispy and flavorful.

- We also had the scallop dumpling, beef hor fun, normal siu mai , black truffled chicken. These were also nice, though not as stand out.

Siri House Dempsey,Sunshinetatty24 L,"A night of real gastronomic treat for us ladies. We have been looking forward to the night after I booked it with Sharon, my beautiful owner and friend.

The pictures speak for themselves but I still gotta rave about it!

From starters to mains to desserts, each rightly perfected.
A‚Äôs top dish is the starter named ‚Äòbikini‚Äô. Nothing sexy but the surprising display and flavours put together totally matches her inner child‚Äôs palate. The complexities within in a simple and pure showcase.
A & B both picked the uni pasta as their top choice. Every strand of pasta was nicely glazed with the rich gravy dripping tinges of uni. It was really all gravy and groovy to us all.
My personal favourite is the KFC (Korean Fried Cauliflower). Somehow the clever concoction of gochujang, spam crisps and toasted sesame transforms a simple vegetable into a magical dish. I‚Äôm
Excited to try my other favourite vegetables- Broccolini and Brussels sprouts next.
I have to give a special mention to our plate of oysters - these babies from Hokkaido as Chef Ivan intro-  were so fresh and succulent.  Pretty much slurped them all up in no time.
Thanks for the fabulous dishes whipped up by chef Ivan and the wonderful service team at Siri House. The food as a whole was delectably enjoyable.
Perfect setting for us ladies to freely enjoy the whole wine and dine experience together.
The free flow of wines and bubbles was merely the tip of the iceberg.
Little did we know that the best part was to be the desserts, which anyone should always have a spare room for.
How do they taste as good as they look? The 3 items were so pretty in their own way, we were admiring so hard that we almost couldn‚Äôt bear to ruin the aesthetic display. But we simply couldn‚Äôt resist sinking our teeth into those delightful desserts. Brought our sweet moments to another level.

Siri House Dempsey,Yeow Yang Neo (YY),"Had a lovely birthday dinner at Siri House. We ordered the uni cream pasta, beef short rib, and sourdough with kombu butter. The sourdough was heavenly! Crispy on the edges, soft inside, and full of flavour. The beef short rib was tender and perfectly cooked, with a rich, savoury sauce. The uni pasta had fresh scallops and a tasty creamy sauce, though it got a bit gelak after a while.

Definitely a very pricey restaurant, so was a bit dejected that we couldn‚Äôt try the dishes we went there for. For the food, the prawn orzo was really delicious! And as expected, dips and pita are a must have. The octopus is really interesting, it is not chewy like normal octopus and was really easy to bite through.

The restaurant was lovely, not too crowded so we could chat easily. And staff were friendly and helpful when we asked for more water.

Blu Kouzina Dempsey,Wen,"Opted for the Taramasalata dip ($20.50+) to go with the Grilled Pita ($5.50) and Koulouri Bread ($7.50). There is the option of three dips but we found it to be overly pricey at $43.50+ and decided to make do with one. Really enjoyed everything, just need to be quick when consuming the bread as it hardens overtime.

We also ordered the Meat Platter Small ($112.50+) to try abit of all the different proteins. The clear winner would be the lamb chop, I would definitely order this specifically for future visits. I was not a fan of the chicken skewer as it was quite tough. The bifteki, which is a meat patty, was not bad and grew on me with subsequent bites. The beef was okay.

For dessert, we got the Baklava ($17.50+). As we were quite full, we ate half here and took away the other two pieces.

Service: excellent. Good recommendations for the food and friendly, professional. Very helpful.

Food; yummy yummy! Tried two types of tacos the lamb and fish. So good. The street food beef skewers are really good.

The seafood menu: must try the fish. It's really good, seabass.

The pork ribs very good too!

Dessert: the coconut cake is really good very interesting. We had the cream by the side just in case. But having it onto the cake is really nice. So if you want, do request to have the cream by the side

CANCHITA - Peruvian Cuisine,Affinity MM,"This is hands-down the only Peruvian restaurant I know of in Singapore, an absolute hidden gem for someone like me who has travelled to South America and loves Peruvian food. I‚Äôve already been back several times.
My favourite ceviche here is the Aquachile Tropical. The Hokkaido scallops were incredibly sweet and tender, beautifully complemented by the vibrant pineapple aguachile, tangy passion fruit chalaquita, and juicy mango. Every bite was refreshing and bursting with flavour. The Nikkei Tuna is also excellent, with a beautiful balance of flavors and textures.
And then there‚Äôs my ultimate favourite, their Peruvian-style seafood rice. Creamier and more risotto-like than a Spanish paella, it comes loaded with scallop in shell, prawns, calamari and fish, all cooked in a rich sauce of Peruvian panca chilli, tomatoes, white wine and cheese. The seafood is incredibly fresh, the portion generous, and every bite bursts with briny sweetness and umami. The mariscada is just as good.
Oh, and spotting Peru‚Äôs national drinks - Chicha Morada and Inka Kola - on the menu during my first visit was such a delightful surprise.

Chorizo was one of my fav

Came here for a birthday celebration!
Ordered the duck taco and it comes with this crazy spicy sauce that was tasty!
We also tried the octopus, and seafood soup. The Seafood soup was pretty sour - not really my kind of taste. The octopus sauce was good! Got a free desert too for the birthday person. We ordered the Coconut cake with cream and that was an absolute delight!

I wanted to take a couple pic with the big green outside to commemorate the date but the waiter seem to prefer to stay indoors.  I feel that the waiter could go a little out of his way to step outside  to take a pic for us.

CANCHITA - Peruvian Cuisine,Desiree Low,"Had an amazing meal at Canchita to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We ordered the Classic Ceviche, Seafood rice and the Octopus A La Brasa, and the restaurant served us complimentary bread to start. All 3 dishes we ordered were amazing and cooked to perfection, extremely flavourful and overall pretty mind blowing. My boyfriend‚Äôs favourite was the seafood rice, while mine was the ceviche. These two dishes are definitely a must order when you‚Äôre there!

Ambience was nice too. The only not so positive feedback I have is that I wish the staff were slightly more attentive to our table!

Thevar,Yuan Li,"My Take on Thevar

„ÄêThe Dress Code Drama„Äë
So, we showed up at Thevar totally unaware about some dress code reminder they sent out. Theyre super strict about dressing smart. I mean, tons of Michelin-starred places has this rule, but most dont make a big deal if you rock up in shorts or whatever. Not Thevar‚Ä¶they hit you with a $50 charge to borrow long pants! Compare that to a place like Les Amis, where theyll hook you up a pair of new pants for free. We ended up wasting like half an hour going back home and coming back to sort out this pant situation, which was such a buzzkill. I later heard that it was some French foodie YouTubers who trashed Thevars staff because they had seen people dining in shorts and accused Thevar as undeserving of their michelin stars. Honestly, why are these guys staring at peoples legs under the table instead of enjoying they‚Äôre food? It totally threw off my dinner vibe. No other fancy restaurant we been to has sent us back to change clothes. they care more about you having a good time. And here‚Äôs the thing: the decor‚Äôs all warm and cozy, like you‚Äôre at someone‚Äôs home, but this stickler attitude about long pants and the staff‚Äôs stiff vibe (except for one guy, more on that later) just didn‚Äôt match that welcoming feel at all.

„ÄêThe Vibe Was Off„Äë
After that rough start, things didn‚Äôt get much better with the atmosphere. The background music was cranked up like we were at some Clarke Quay bar, not a Michelin-starred spot. Plus, the dining areas all one big room, so you hear *everything* from other tables. There was these two ladies laughing and chatting so loud the whole night, it was impossible to tune out. Like, what was so hilarious? It felt like they didn‚Äôt care about anyone else trying to enjoy their meal. I was annoyed that Thevar seemed more obsessed with enforcing they‚Äôre dress code than keeping the noise in check. Shorts under a table? Barely noticable. But loud music and cackling? That hits everyone. It really messed with my dining experience. The cozy, homey decor made you expect a chill, warm vibe, but the strict rules and most of the staff acting all robotic totally clashed with that. However One server, Elgin, was a total gem, he treated us like friends and made us feel right at home, unlike the others who seemed like they were just going through the motions.

„ÄêThe Food Saved the Day„Äë
Okay, but lets talk about the food. It was honestly awesome and pulled me out of my grumpy mood. The dishes looked and tasted amazing, and the lamb? So tender and just perfect. A couple of courses was a bit salty, but nothing too bad. I went for the chefs special (king crab) and a masala tea as extras, and both were totally worth it.
In fact the king crab was unreal, tasting like baby lotus root. It is so unique and delicious. but there was this small piece of cartilage in it that should‚Äôve been removed. The attention to detail could be improved. Still, the food was a highlight. Plus, the price was super reasonable, way lower than what you typically see at other Michelin two-star or even one-star restaurants, and the service from Elgin especially was on point. The food and drinks really turned things around and made me focus on the good stuff.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thevar/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19be904b5f4f:0x62de1787837fb0b8!8m2!3d1.2936417!4d103.8414263!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOdVgySnhiMDlCRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCNAEED4!16s%2Fg%2F11gnrlkl99"
Thevar,Zi-Xin Yan,"Food was excellent! But it is a tad bit more expensive than the other fine dining places but it‚Äôs worth trying once. We had the tasting course for dinner and my tummy was practically bursting at the end of the night!
We started off being served with the snacks - idli, chaat, pork & puri. My favourite was the tomato heirloom chaat! The different flavours just bursts in your mouth and the tomato is very appetising. Honestly this was a very good starter as it made me look forward to the rest of my meal.
We were then served the French turbot, lobster, chicken and guava gujiya. The French turbot had an interesting flavour in it and it was the best among the 4. Unfortunately the lobster was tough and chewy so we didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Chicken roti was deliciously savoury - the bread was crispy and it goes very well with the chicken whose flavours are very well mixed.
The lamb was the highlight (apart from the chaat) of the night and the briyani that goes with it was so good! We even asked for additional serving (which is probably why my dress was practically bursting at the end of the night). I really enjoyed the thogayal as it was very different from the conventional ones.
Dessert was just alright for me as I‚Äôm usually more of a pastry/ cake kind of person rather than ice cream.

We ordered our classic aperitif Negroni for a start, amazingly on point. Kudos to the bartender. Overall the ambiance was pretty cool with a laid back vibe. Definitely a good place to enjoy for some good drinks/ and lip smacking food.

A must order:
-Tokyo Hummus serve with curry chips (soooo smooth and creamy and we love the idea of using edamamme instead of chickpea)

-Uni and bone marrow (literally melt in your mouth sooo good!)

-Duck Gyoza =foie gras with orange ginger ponzu (loving it really give a nice balance flavour that is not overpowering the foie gras)

The Spot - Singapore,W T,"Third visit here. I don't visit this place unless there's promo cos i feel it's overpriced for the quality. Came because i had the kris+ 1 for 1 birthday privilege. Was planning to let my family try this place. As there are 4 of us, i called to check if the 1 for 1 can be used with the 3 course set lunch, a staff checked with another staff (manager?) she said yes, and i reconfirmed this cos some restaurants are pretty strict about this, and she said can.

When i arrived and checked again with the staff before ordering, the manager on duty, however, said no. I argued for a bit because i called to ask and another staff said yes (my mistake was not getting the staff's name or recording our convo). He insisted no, and was not apologetic at all.

It was my birthday that day and i was really mad but as i was there with my family, we ordered 2 main courses and 2 small plates.

The small plates were so small our mouths dropped open when it came. 3 scallops for 30+, 4 tiger prawns  (which was quite small compared to those my mum get at the market) at around 30+ iirc, the taste was above average, but this is way overpriced.

The lobster linguine was not bad, but i wouldn't pay 52+ for just 2 small pieces of lobster. Arteastique lobster pasta comes with 1 huge full lobster and it is 38+. If it wasn't for the 1 for 1 i wouldn't visit... cos we were not even full after our meal. This place is clearly targeted at the expats staying there.

I hope the management can ensure that all staff are aware of the promos happening and the T&Cs of it, provide more value for money food, and imprive their service quality. The attitude of the manager on duty (an indian gentleman) was disappointing.

NOX - Dine in the Dark,Donald Ong,"While the culinary experience and atmospheric concept at NOX were commendable, my visit was marred by deeply disappointing service. During the meal, my phone screen briefly lit up due to an urgent call from home (my mother had suffered a fall, and I was unable to return the call for two hours). Instead of showing empathy, the staff reprimanded me harshly, which felt unnecessary and insensitive. Another diner (a Western gentleman) also contributed to the discomfort by loudly voicing his complaints, adding to the unpleasantness.

Though the food and ambiance were enjoyable, the S$300 price tag raises expectations for professionalism and courtesy, which were sorely lacking.

Summer Pavilion,Kelvin Tan,"I had the opportunity to dine at Summer Pavilion at The Ritz-Carlton, Singapore, and it was a memorable experience overall. We ordered the Hyacinth Dinner Menu with some customisations ‚Äî swapping the barbecued suckling pig for Iberico pork with honey sauce, and the stewed pork for braised duck (from the Peking duck we also ordered separately).

From the start, we were served a refreshing plum juice with strong, appetising sour notes, and sugar-coated cashews that were not overly sweet ‚Äî a lovely way to begin the meal. The lychee oolong tea also deserves praise ‚Äî aromatic with a good balance of floral and earthy tones, pairing well with the savoury dishes throughout.

Highlights:

Peking duck: Crispy skin, nicely complemented by spring onions, cucumber, sauce, and Êò•È•º. Portions of condiments were slightly limited but replenishable on request.

Iberico pork: Sweet with honey glaze, tender with good marbling. Portion was small, but quality was top-notch.

Double-boiled sea whelk soup: Rich, flavourful, and nourishing. The nostoc algae added an interesting berry-like texture.

Steamed Dong Xing grouper: Fresh, clean taste, complemented by a surprisingly light and well-balanced sauce. The dried beancurd skin was a standout.

Poached rice with lobster: The broth was generous, almost too much for the small amount of rice, but flavourful nonetheless. A comforting dish, though the lobster didn‚Äôt particularly stand out.

Some dishes were a little on the heavier side ‚Äî particularly the scallops and abalone, where the sauces, although tasty, were thick and left a cloying mouthfeel, needing tea to refresh the palate. The same applied to the braised duck (which we requested in place of the pork) ‚Äî well-executed but understandably rich due to the nature of duck meat.

The dessert course was a delightful way to end: a chilled mango sago with pomelo that was light and refreshing.

The service was excellent ‚Äî warm, attentive, and thoughtful. Staff kindly waited for us to take photos before portioning and serving, and they were accommodating with our dish modifications.

The ambience was elegant and peaceful. Our table by the window allowed for a spacious, open feel, and the overall atmosphere was calm and suitable for intimate gatherings or celebrations.

Overall: While no single dish was groundbreaking, the consistent quality, fresh ingredients, and refined presentation made the experience special. It's a place where you can enjoy an elevated Chinese meal in a refined setting, especially for special occasions. The price point is steep, but justifiable considering the location, service, and quality of ingredients.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Summer+Pavilion/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19a84edb49eb:0xc830785b70ea7472!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a9b0062087:0x89bff20918842d33!8m2!3d1.2906013!4d103.8603033!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5UVU5STTAxbVMwdEJFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIWBBM!16s%2Fg%2F1th592rh"

Summer Pavilion,Joey Lee,"Went for a birthday celebration during weekday lunchtime and was surprised that it was almost packed. Despite this, it was not noisy because there was ample space between the tables and it didn't feel cramped or uncomfortable. This is very much welcomed because a lot of Chinese restaurants tend to be jam packed and the din can make it difficult to have a decent conversation.

Since this is a Michelin one-star fine dining place, it seemed like there was an effort put into the selection of utensils and plates used. Personally, I felt that the black and white version looked classy while the other colours felt a bit odd.

The appetiser was a dish of sweetened cashew nuts which again was quite different from most appetisers at Chinese restaurants that tend to be on the savoury side. Usually, I don't touch the appetisers at all but I finished this in no time.

As for the dim sum, the general consensus was that some dishes fared better than the others i.e. deep fried lobster roll and sweet corn prawn dumplings. Opinions were split for the other dim sum - some felt that the skin of the dumplings was too thick while the prawn filling was fresh and flavourful. The lingzhi dumpling was a tad lacklustre and lacked a wow factor. The abalone dumpling in clear broth also had a mixed bag of reviews - the broth's abalone umami was felt to be a bit fishy by some while others relished it.

On the other hand, the dishes were more well-received than the dim sum. The pomelo chicken pot was delicious but the pomelo's flavour was probably fully absorbed by the dish to the extent that the fruit no longer bore any resemblance to its original taste and texture. The braised vegetables with mushrooms would go very well with plain rice since it was a bit on the salty side but still could be eaten on its own. As for the poached rice with lobster and poached fish noodles with lobster,  the former was more well-received.

Since we were celebrating a birthday, there was a prosperity buns platter given for free and we bought a slice of cake from Colony which was added to it. The staff helped us to cut the cake and served it together with the buns.

Special mention goes to the staff Laura and Sky who were very polite and prompt with their service. They definitely made the dining experience a lot more pleasant.

Overall, I thought that the food was good with some misses which probably were due to personal preferences. The prices are definitely higher than the norm so whether you find this worth it or not probably hinges on whether the taste is to your liking.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Summer+Pavilion/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19a84edb49eb:0xc830785b70ea7472!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a9b0062087:0x89bff20918842d33!8m2!3d1.2906013!4d103.8603033!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5UVU5STTAxbVMwdEJFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIWBBM!16s%2Fg%2F1th592rh"

Braci,Chu Wee Wong,"This place has been on my list for the longest time, but someone never got to it.  My wife and I dad a wonderful weekday afternoon celebrating her birthday there - one of the best fine dining lunches I‚Äôve had, ever!  This is one of the very few restaurants with the full degustation menu available for lunch AND dinner.  It was a small place; vibe was friendly, warm and cosy, nearly all tables right next to an open kitchen.  Great to see the team at work and the camaraderie.  It was particularly nice to have Chef Matteo serve and explain most of his creations - he provided insight into the inspirations, ingredients and techniques behind them.  We were blown away by the complexity yet congruity and balance of the multiple layers of tastes and textures.

Braci,Janice Lee,"After the wonderful and memorable lunch I had at Braci many years ago, I have been thinking of going back again. And the International Women‚Äôs Day Special at Braci gave me the exact motivation to push aside all my commitments, prior plans and beauty appointment to come here to enjoy these specially curated dishes, with southeast Asian influences, created by the female chefs at Braci. This is one of the best dining experiences I have.

Instead of serving pure Italian food for the special occasion, the dishes in the menu feature European cuisine with Southeast Asian influences, inspired by the chefs‚Äô backgrounds. I totally love it. There are so many flavours packed in beautiful harmony within each dish, It is complex and spellbinding.

I opt to dien at the exciting rooftop bar with a quaint bar counter and 270 ¬∞ panoramic unblocked view of the Singapore River, the landscape of Marina Bay and skyline of the city. It is so breathtaking, and the soft breeze blowing makes it even better Yes, I feel like I‚Äôm living it up when dining here.

The service is exceptional, impeccable and friendly, completing the exceptional experience of savouring awesome food with awesome ambience and service.

Makan Makan by Chef Li Vian is a lovely trio of Tom Kha Kai, Corn Tarlet and Scallop Semifreddo. I love the transition from simulating taste of Tom Kha Kai to smokiness of Corn Tarlet, and finally to luxurious treat of Scallop Semifreddo.

Suan Ni Bai Rou by Chef Aaron is one of the best pork dish I have. With the pork belly soaked with wine, sprinkled with fried shallots, paired with umami rich Sakura Ebi Furikake and zesty cool Cucumber Snow, the medley of rich flavours is amazing.

Aglio&Olio, But I don't like Garlic is very interestingly named by its creater, Chef Yoke. Given a twist to Braci's signature 32 Egg Yolks Tagliolini with creamy sweet Bafun Uni, which is by the way the best pasta, garlic foam and hamaguri clams are added for the extra oomph in taste and crunchy texture. The Tagliolini here is a must-try.

Tropical Tart by Pastry Chef Yasmin is a delightful dessert made up of mango mousse, passion fruit and coconut sorbet. Full of nuanced flavours, it tastes refreshing and rich at the same time. I love it.

ÂÜúËÄïËÆ∞ÊπñÂçóÂúüËèú Nong Geng Ji @ Orchardgateway,Carol C,"Reviews seemed hyped up but personally found the food just average; the cooking style is generally very oily and salty. Was there for lunch on a weekend, lots of seats. Observed that it starts getting filled up around 1pm onwards. Do reserve in advance if you want to avoid the ques. Scan QR at the table to place order.
1) Stir-Fried Pork with Abalone and Chilli Combo: enjoyed the tiny chewy Abalone pieces dry fried wth pork, gren chillies & garlic chunks. The green chili had a sweet taste to it, wasn't at all spicy. Very oily at the base of the dish.

2)Sauerkraut Fish with Soup: sour and mild spicy broth with fresh slices of fish. Goes really well with rice and makes you want more of it.

3)Stir-Fried Pork Intestines with Sauerkraut: the pork intestines had an interesting smokey flavour, no foul taste. There was more oil than gravy.

4) Signature Lemon Tea: tasted normal and quite diluted.

5) Special Fermented Tofu ÁâπËâ≤Ë±ÜËÖê‰π≥: this is actually like fu yu. Unless you are having rice, please don't order this coz its very salty. We ended up having to takeaway the balance.

Easiest way to locate the outlet, go up to Level 1, head toward the area where IRVINS or Chagee is located. You will see an escalator in front of Chagee going down to B1. You wont miss it coz there are large green signages with this restaurant brand featured on the sides.

The front counter will sign you up for a free membership with your name and mobile. We got a $6 discount off our bill with the membership. Diners who leave a google review will receive a free dessert (glutinous rice cake with brown sugar) hence the high rating I suppose.

As the restaurant was still quite empty initially, some of the male staff didn't know what to do with themselves, so they stood near our table chatting away which was quite annoying when we were trying to enjoy our meal in peace. Was very parched and thirsty after the meal.

Private Dining Singapore | Avodah by Stellamoon,EduEdge English Tuition,"Dining at Avodah by Chef Kent and his wife Stella was an extraordinary experience!

From the moment we stepped in, we felt welcomed into the warmth of their home, surrounded by soothing lighting, gentle music and beautiful art pieces hand-painted by Stella herself. The ambiance was truly unique and set the perfect tone for an unforgettable evening.

Chef Kent and Stella‚Äôs hospitality was impeccable. They shared wonderful stories, and Kent even sang for us on his guitar, adding a personal touch that made the evening feel magical.

Every dish was crafted with the freshest ingredients and an abundance of love and passion, making it hard to pick a favourite because each one was a masterpiece.

The meal began with their homemade olive, bread and butter, setting the bar high.

From the wagyu bresaola with burrata cheese to the Japanese lobster bisque with Hokkaido scallops, every bite was a delight.

The slow oven-baked tenderloin with cherry tomato on the vine and Japanese leek was cooked to perfection, while the clams pasta with white wine and ooba was bursting with flavor.

To top it all off, we had handmade glutinous rice balls in sweet ginger soup‚Äîthe perfect ending to a beautiful meal.

Chef Kent and Stella took exceptional care to ensure we were well-fed and comfortable throughout the evening. It was clear that they poured their hearts into both the food and the experience.

Loulou - French Cuisine & Wine Bar,The Biodynamic Duo,"Visited on a Saturday for brunch. This was my second time. Probably one of the best deals out there for free flow brunch (35$ for 1.5 hours; top up a bit more and you can get free flow oysters for 55$; the oysters are tiny but good).

Service is superb and you won‚Äôt have to call to top up the glasses.

Stuffed eggplant is really good if you like‚Ä¶ eggplant (it‚Äôs a parmigiana with some different spices)

The beef tartare on bone marrow is superb - 5stars.

The ‚Äúpasta‚Äù is a bit of a letdown, the sauce is amazing but not a fan of those little pasta balls (recommend to change to other type of pasta)

Desert - wow!

I‚Äôd love to try their dinner menu next.

1 Star ‚Äì Terrible:
Extremely disappointing. Poor taste, bad texture, and low quality.

Edible but far from enjoyable. Lacks flavor, freshness, or proper preparation.

4 Stars ‚Äì Good:
Tasty and well-prepared. Shows quality and care, with quite a few standout elements.

The Coconut Club Beach Road,ivan.,"Reservation is only allowed for level 2 communal which comes with minimum spend of $40 per pax.

The ambience and service were great!

However for the price we paid ($300+ for 5 of us, with one alcohol each), we didn‚Äôt find it filling and satisfying.

The rice set with egg and condiments is $9! The main dish prices are quite steep too.

NAEUM Restaurant,JT YY,"I finally get to try Naeum's lunch - Episode Recollection. Had been anticipating it and i was not disappointed at all. I think all the dishes complemented each other. Even though I do not eat/like duck, I tried one piece and i can still say that the duck dish was flavourful especially around the fats and skin part. Each dish practically have something that I like about. Love the seasoning and texture of the taco galbi. My partner likes the muchim from the appetiser set. The soup/sauce complenents the sea bream. I was tempted to finish every drop of the buckwheat sauce. The fish skin is so light yet crispy. The sesame/truffle makes the rice so flavourful that I deserted the sauce from the banchan. The sorbet and fruits was not too sweet or melty, instead there was a mixture of crunchy and softness. I love all the 3 korean sweets too! I recommend the Jiran Jigyo, Chamomile takju (rice wine) if you can only do 1 glass. Staff were all friendly, polite and professional. Small restaurant but doesn't feel packed or squeezy.

BAKALAKI Greek Taverna,JacobBiscuitsAreBest,"I was absolutely dazzled by the overall experience here at Bakalaki Greek Taverna. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food all played crucial roles in making this one of my best restaurant experiences.

The servers and waiters were all polite, friendly and enthusiastic. Service was quick and neat. The restaurant was spacious and very fancy,  which provided a nice space while dining.

Food was simply phenomenal. We had a starter of bread with two dips. Tyrokrafteri: spicy feta cheese with greek yoghurt and roasted bell peppers, and Melitzanosalata Agioritiki: a smoky eggplant spread with red peppers, garlic, and olive oil. The eggplant salsa was really tasty, the texture was just right and the smokiness elevated it very much.  The Tyrokrafteri was just heavenly. One of the best cheese spreads I‚Äôve ever had, just pure deliciousness that went well with the bread.

The Htapodi Grilled Octopus was the star of today‚Äôs show. Grilled to perfection with extra virgin olive oil, it was tender and not overly chewy, which shower that it was cooked just right. The taste was very addictive and the char added more flavour to the octopus.

Grilled Lamb Chops and potatoes were next. Beautifully grilled medium rare lamb was juicy and tender, the potatoes were no exception, oven baked just right.

We also ordered a chicken yards Souvlaki that  I found surprisingly good. The pita bread and fries also went well with the Tyrokrafteri Dip.

The Brtam oven-baked vegetables were decent, but the eggplants were the highlight of that dish.

We got a free Baklava for dessert from the staff as well. The custard and pastry were drenched in honey that was delicious, but got it was a little too heavy for me.

Overall a fantastic experience here.

BAKALAKI Greek Taverna,Faizal Noor,"Bakalaki Greek Taverna is a lovely Greek restaurant in Martin road. The place feels warm and cozy, with simple but stylish decor. It‚Äôs a nice spot for a relaxed meal with friends or family.

I tried the grilled octopus legs and the Greek doughnuts, called loukoumades. The octopus was soft, tasty, and had a nice grilled flavor. It wasn‚Äôt chewy at all, which is a good sign it was cooked well. The loukoumades were amazing‚Äîcrispy on the outside, soft inside, and covered in sweet honey and nuts. They were the perfect way to end the meal.

The staff were friendly and helpful. They made me feel welcome and were happy to explain the dishes. Even though I only ordered two items, I could tell the food here is made with care and fresh ingredients.

Here are my üîù3 favourite picks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The Irish Duck was the winning dish of the night, perfectly succulent with crispy skin, accompanied with an unbeatable combo of eggplant, tomato, burrata and basil.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Coming in at a close second was the pasta dish, Baby Squid linguine with a fresh tomato and squid ink sauce. I didn‚Äôt expect to like this dish as I‚Äôm not a fan of squid generally, but wow! This pasta totally blew me away with its punchy smoky flavors. I‚Äôm so impressed at how flavorful the tomato sauce was!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Another banger of a dish was the Scampi, with a robust garlicky and citrusy sauce. I loved the subtle flavor of anchovies coming through, not overwhelming at all lending just the right touch of balance.

Buona Terra,Muzainy Shahiefisally,"A sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It‚Äôs free anyway. Canap√©s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l‚Äôoeil to make it look like tomatoes it‚Äôs actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef‚Äôs take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one‚Äôs pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos).

Kotuwa,Yi Ling,"We had dinner here recently and while the food was generally good, the service experience‚Äîspecifically from one male waiter‚Äîwas disappointing enough to ruin the evening.

Food:
Most dishes were flavorful and well-presented. Highlights included the Crab Cutlet, Jaffna Duck Curry, Dhal, and Egg Hopper. Cocktails were creative, and portions were decent though some felt overpriced (e.g., Chicken Kottu at $28). Overall, food rating: 4/5.

Service Issue:
Unfortunately, the dining experience was soured by the behavior of one waiter:

Pushy from the start:
At 6:30 p.m., while I was still within the 2-hour dining window (reservation at 6:00), he pressured me to order because the table had to be released by 8:00pm

üò° Rude comments:
When my friend and I took some photos of our food (which had just all arrived), he came over and said, ""My goodness, why are you still taking photos? Just eat‚Äîthe food is going cold."" That comment really soured the mood. It was off-putting, especially since we were still within our reserved time. Who cares if the food gets cold? We‚Äôre the ones eating it. Even if it was meant as a joke, it didn‚Äôt land well and made things uncomfortable.

From then on, he kept glancing at our table, as if calculating when to usher us out. I even noticed him clearing neighboring tables prematurely, while guests were still seated.

Repeated interruptions:
He kept hovering and watching our table. At 7:45 p.m., he asked if we wanted to pack the rest to go‚Äîwhile we were still eating.

Inconsistent treatment:
Other diners weren‚Äôt being rushed as intensely by him same way, even those seated before us. Why was our table being singled out? Was our specific table booked for someone else? Or was there another reason behind the different treatment? I truly can‚Äôt understand.

He came again at 7:55 p.m. to inform us that the next guests would now be delayed until 8:15 p.m. At that point, his presence felt so intrusive that we no longer want to continue eating.

Food is meant to be enjoyed. But being hovered over and rushed like that ruined our appetite. And hey, we spent about $100 per pax. This service is not it. Perhaps he held a supervisory role and felt the need to be the ‚Äúbad cop,‚Äù while the other staff remained warm and courteous. Regardless, the disparity in service was jarring.

This constant pressure made the meal stressful instead of enjoyable. Other staff were kind and professional, but this particular male waiter left a very negative impression.

I genuinely wanted to enjoy the experience and write a review about the food, but due to the service, I can‚Äôt enjoy the food properly nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kotuwa/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19863df2af2b:0xd871e5142f922b9!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a2f74116cd:0xc4370f8cb9d03f10!8m2!3d1.2929949!4d103.8388598!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEVc3JpX2xhbmthbl9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5DYkRaTVVuVjNSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECBsQRg!16s%2Fg%2F11lgy39d9p"
Kotuwa,Matt Ho,"Came here as a party of 4 on a Saturday night, after my fianc√©e's recommendation. Lived up to it.

Had the Dallo Baduma (calamari), lamb shank, gowa mal kiri hodi (cauliflower), chicken kottu and egg hopper.

Servings looked slightly small initially, so we called for the waiter and asked to add 1 serving of yellow rice. The waiter was attentive enough to know that we just wanted a small serving each to pair with all the gravies, and suggested a half portion instead of the ""1 serving"" I had asked for without looking at the menu. She explained the size, and we understood why when it came. In the end the whole meal was just the right amount for us.

Food was very well balanced and spiced - every bit of the spice (and spicy) taste but without too much intensity that pierces. Good taste without being overbearing. Calamari was my favourite as if had the most variety of textures within the dish and it came together so well. Lamb meat came off neatly and was tender. Cauliflower had a nice char, and sauce was quite perfect for me.

Wished they had more dessert options - many had coconut which I didn't like.

VUE,–ºŒπ—ï—ï—É–≤—îlŒ±2828,"Surprise birthday dinner by the hubby at VUE ‚Äî a romantic night with stunning views of Marina Bay Sands!

We both went for the 4-course menu ($168 per pax), and the dishes were beautifully presented and generally well-executed. I had the pan-seared foie gras, grilled lobster tail, USDA filet mignon, and strawberry osmanthus cake. My husband opted for the scallop & pearls, wild forest mushroom risotto, Spanish octopus, and chocolate peanut butter dessert.

We thoroughly enjoyed most of the dishes ‚Äî highlights included the perfectly cooked lobster tail and the rich, tender filet mignon. However, the scallop and risotto were unfortunately on the salty side, which slightly took away from the experience.

What held me back from giving a full 5-star rating was the service, which had some inconsistencies. While the team kindly helped take photos for us and even surprised us with a lovely birthday dessert and handwritten card, there were noticeable lapses. Some courses were served without explanation, and there were two mix-ups with our orders: our first course was mistakenly sent to the adjacent table, and the desserts were switched.

Overall, it was still a special and memorable evening ‚Äî the ambiance, view, and culinary highlights made it worth it, but service could definitely be tightened for a truly fine dining experience.

Estate,Serene Ker Huan Yew,"29April2025 (Tuesday) : Estate, Hilton Hotel, has Excellent & Humble Chefs and Assistant Manager

We celebrated our auntie Mdm Pauline Seow's Birthday at the Estate.  On that day, Chef William Tan Ngiap Wah was on duty.

While we were enjoying the awesome buffet spread at Estate, we were greeted by Chef William Tan.  We just briefly mentioned to William that we were celebrating Mdm Seow's Birthday on that day.

Towards the end of the buffet at 2.11pm on 2025-04-29, Chef William PERSONALLY brought out a BEAUTIFUL and WONDERFULLY handcrafted Birthday Cake that is Crimson in colour and that matches Auntie Seow's red attire as well.

This cake & Chef William have indeed left a deep impression in all of our hearts!  The Cake resembles a blooming flower with a piece of chocolate written ""Happy Birthday"" on it and one candle was placed on top of it. We were all SUPER impressed with Chef William's sharp observation ( the Crimson Cake matches Auntie Seow‚Äôs Blouse), Culinary skills (such a beautiful cake), his Warmth attitude, Great & Friendly Customer Service and Humility.

I ask myself, which restaurant has their Chef come to our table to greet us and deliver such great service and a Birthday Cake?  Only Estate by Hilton Hotel.  Other Restaurants usually have their waiters and waitresses deliver the Birthday Cake to the patron.

Even though it is already 2 weeks after our dining appointment, this desire to compliment Chef William Tan never goes away. If we did not leave Chef William Tan a 5-star review, it will be wrong of us.

Assistant Manager Ms. Pauline Ng has very good customer service.  In the midst of her duties, she will always pop by and check with us if everything is alright. Furthermore, she will on and off come and do small talks with us.  We are pleased with her sincerity.  She does not do it out of duty, but out of passion.  She deserves a 5-Star review as well.

Uncle Ray is another Chef that deserves my 5-Star Review.  He has excellent memory.  He remembers that I patronised the former Estate known as 333 Somerset.  I am so impressed with him.  Imagine how many diners he has met during the course of his work? He is such an awesome staff who serves with a heart.

As our diet is Kosher Diet (meaning we do NOT take pork, prawns, lobsters, crabs, scallops, squid, cuttlefish, sotong, abalones, sea cucumber, clams, mussels), we still have plenty of food to eat for the buffet as they use Beef, Mutton, Duck, Chicken, Fish & Vegetables to cook many of their dishes.

Management, please help us thank Assistant Manager Pauline, Chef William Tan and Chef Ray for their Excellent Customer Service & Culinary Skills.

We will definitely return for more dining pleasures at Estate, by Hilton Hotel.

Estate,Kirsten Hoon,"We were there last Tuesday for the Meat & Seafood dinner buffet.

We headed straight for the chilled seafood selection, where generous amounts of fresh sashimi, clams, mussels, prawns, crab claws and legs, and oysters greeted us.

Then it was off to the warm foods section, and it was so hard to resist taking multiple plates of the melt in your mouth foie gras with unagi.

The Sunday Roast (beef), which was better than the Surf & Turf (lamb & crab leg) in our opinion. It went well with their mash potatoes, asparagus and carrots well.

The Singapore chilli prawn was slightly sweet, while the herbal drunken tiger prawns was perfect to warm you up during the rainy weather of last week. There was also a great selection of Indian curries, briyani and nanns.

Make sure you leave room for desserts. Their gelato was light and not too sweet, provided you don't go too heavy handed at the toppings bar.

The service we experienced with our server, Si Thu Win, was exemplary. He cleared our plates without us having to ask. When we requested for a nut cracker to open the crab claws we took, he took the initiative of bringing finger bowls for us to wash our hands. All through our time there, he was always there with a smile.

When it was time to pay the bill, we were served by Steven, who helped us secure a discount by suggesting we sign up as Hilton Honors Members.

Marguerite,Zane,"From the start till the end, what an experience. I would give 6 stars to both the services and foods.

The buggy ride was a godsend on a sunny day and the sense of luxury really started from there. The restaurant was naturally scented from what I presumed coming from the flowers in the flower dome. It wasn‚Äôt over powering the sense of smell.

The 4 courses lunch with a choice of wagyu or lamb was splendidly prepared. I liked the lamb better though. Overall, I enjoyed the journey that the chef curated for the taste buds.

The service staffs were attentive and professional. It‚Äôs commendable that they didn‚Äôt try to sell you bottled still water but served refreshing cold complementary water. I was also surprised by the reasonably priced tea to pair with the mignardises.

Marguerite,J C,"Hands down one of the best Michelin starred meals in Singapore. Most miss the mark, or are overrated, since the Michelin standard in Singapore is definitely a notch or two lower than the rest of the world, especially given the exorbitant prices they have to charge to cover rent here‚Ä¶ but this place not only deserves their Michelin star, but has one of the most stunning locations to top it off. Whilst it is technically indoors it very much gives outdoor vibes and the light is beautiful.

You not only get free entry to the flower dome, or a buggy ride to and from the restaurant (if needed), with their amazing service. You get every single dish on the menu really hitting the mark and an open kitchen concept which is very unique and you can walk straight up to and watch your meal get plated.

My wife also really enjoyed this (we went for our anniversary), and whilst most Michelin places have a couple of dishes that aren‚Äôt quite perfect, this menu left us extremely impressed, there wasn‚Äôt a dish that missed or lacked balance or flavour. Executed to perfection.

Wanted to give it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏ès because of the excellent service from the crew... but cannot because of the food.

The Buah Keluak in the Ayam Buah Keluak dish wasn't stuffed back into the shells... so it took away the old-school 'dig the paste out' fun out of the dish. They gave us a separate addition scoop because there were 3 of us and we ordered the set, which was for 2. Very thoughtful of them.

The Babi Pongteh was delicious but the babi was fat fat fat... the fat layer was gooey and overwhelming.

The Chendol was terrific though... the chendol bits were plump and springy.

The tables they had were huge and wide... making intimate conversations across the table a bit tough. Made the restaurant noisy because everyone had to raise their voices talking amongst themselves.

The food was a nice blend of south East Asian elements. Everything felt harmonious and intentional. I loved that they included what the chefs liked in some of the dishes, it made the experience feel more personal. I also loved that there was some freedom to eat the dish however you wanted.

Atmosphere was quite relaxing. Music was good and tables were spaced out nicely.

Service was attentive, my special request was met, service speed, cutlery change, water top up were all well taken care of.

The Green Lip Abalone layer with veiled bamboo fungus beneath was tenderly cooked & drizzled over with a delicious angelica herb sauce (inspired by local Yong Tau Fu dish).

Next came a XO sauce dip made up of spiced cod roe, tiger prawn was an excellent match with the warm buttery house made flatbread.

A refreshing palate cleansing ginger sorbet was served before we moved on to the perfectly grilled Yellowtail Kingfish.

The main course of Yugo Crossbreed Wagyu was my favourite! It came with a mixture of colourful garlic sauces ranging from Jungle Garlic, Black Garlic and even an in-house concocted green Garlic Chilli Sauce üßÑüßÑüßÑ A pepperish umami rich beef broth (inspired by our local Bak Kut Teh soup) added a nice finish to the meat dish.

Finally, it was dessert time and we got our taste of the most unusual - Green Chilli Ice Cream üç® The ice cream was creamy (not spicy) & came with bakkwa bits, pineapple tart style paste rolled into tiny ball, almond flakes. A truly interesting ice cream flavor we must say üå∂Ô∏è

The lunch then wrapped up with locally inspired Petite Fours and Mignardis.

Overall - I truly enjoyed the 1.5 hour Tasting Menu at Quenino. It was a lovely visual, sensory & culinary experience highly recommended for those looking to explore asian inspired flavors

Lynnette's Kitchen (Private Dining),Peter A. Knipp,"The world‚Äôs Best Beef Rendang, of course all other dishes amazing, and the Chili Crabs two ways! Doesn‚Äôt get better than that!

Dearest Lynnette! Today was just amazing, what privilege! You are getting better & better! Thank you for allowing us into your home! The food was perfect, the company, true Family! We appreciate everything you have done for us! All Guests are praising your food! Simply PERFECT! Thank you so much! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôáüëçüèª

The Kitchen Goddess, A Gastronomic Excellence Experience!

A Cultural Medallion Recipient, A 1st Violin, A retired Co-Concert Master with the SSO (Singapore Symphonie Orchester), turned Master Chef in her own right! (Former Miele Ambassador) and most importantly a Personal Family Friend for almost 32 years! Ms. Lynnette  Seah!

Having known Lynnette for that many years, and being proud to have this friendship I have always been inspired by her artistic prowess but especially by her culinary forte, and her being of proud Peranakan heritage,  Combine all that and one is in for a treat!

Had quite a number of meals with Lynnette over the years, but last nights dining experience, topped it all. She was exuding a lust for life, a degree of happiness and a level of contentment that clearly showed she has arrived at the higher echelons of culinary mastery!

To be fortunate enough to be allowed into her home, is in itself an experience of perfect hospitality, but be aware, trying to make a booking (preferably in a group of 10-12) can be challenging as her popularity has risen to a level that you better plan well in advance! And trust me the who‚Äôs who, that have graced these homely walls, bears testament to her ability to deliver an exceptional experience!

The Food:
We started off with a modernised version of Kung Pau Pau, braised pork served on a single slice of Fried Mantou, eaten like a sandwich, it was the perfect way to start off! The tender Pork Belly braised in a multitude of herbs and spices, pure soft & tender joy! The fragrance still lingers in my mouth! üíØpointer!

Followed was a unique Salted Egg Sri Lanka Crab, and while I personally have never been a super fan of salted egg dishes, this creative gem was simply superb, I truly had to restrain myself not to fill up on this marvel

Also served one of Lynnette‚Äôs number one favourites, Beef Rendang, truly another üíØ pointer, this dish should never be missed when dining here, it‚Äôs complexity of spices, cooked to such degree of tenderness shows the true craftsmanship of someone who knows what they are doing! A Klassiker!

The Highlight of the evening, at least for me, was the creation of a Laksa-Paella! It was Lynnette‚Äôs idea, and should be copyrighted! I think it was a Spanish Symphony meeting the Great Asian Violinist, a composition which I will try to emulate one day! A sensational concoction of truly the best of east & west!

The main, was one of the best Prime Rib Roasts I had in years! Perfectly Cooked, and as my right hand dining partner proudly proclaimed: Lawry‚Äôs, step aside! Accompanied by superb vegetables and a wonderful gravy, it was a truly fitting finale to an outstanding meal.

No more space left for what looked like a perfect Almond & Pistachio Cake for dessert, we called it a night, Filled with outstanding everything, friendship, hospitality, gastronomic delights . A perfect evening!

Morsels Restaurant & Gastro Wine Bar | Morsels Private Dining,Javier Lim,"Founded by Celebrity Chef Petrina Loh in 2013, Morsels is located in the lush greenery of Dempsey Hill in a historical Civil Service Clubhouse built during the British era. We enjoyed the inviting and homely vibes which resembles a cozy barnyard cottage while we explore the interesting art, paintings and landscape photographs.

Chef Petrina's love for culture, food anthropology and artisanal foods gives her inspiration to create progressive fusion cuisine, which promise nothing but the best. We are impressed with the unique combinations of each dish that tantalise our taste buds with every bite.

Impressive combination of textures and flavors with fermented aguachile, pickled fungus, ikura and ao nori rice puff. The natural sweetness of the Hokkaido scallop, enhanced by the umami richness of shio koji and kombu, is incredibly delicate.
ü•üPulled Duck dumpling $30
The tender pulled duck inside the dumpling provides a rich, savory depth, especially when paired with a warm, aromatic brodo. The pickled kale adds a pleasant contrast of tanginess to balance the richness, while the juniper kombu oil offers an earthy, slightly piney flavor, elevating the umami notes.
‚ù§Ô∏èBurnt Red Cabbage $20
The Burnt Red Cabbage with romesco, manchego, and pumpkin seed bubu arare is an intriguing dish, blending smoky, nutty, and crunchy elements. Perfect combination of bold flavors and textures!
üêüThreadfin $34
The firm threadfin paired well with the slightly tangy and umami-rich fermented tomato jus, adding a layer of depth and acidity. The creamy yucca mash adds a starchy smoothness, while the ikura provides bursts of briny saltiness, enhancing the overall flavor profile.
üêÆUS Rib Finger (1/2 size) $22
Impressive fusion of HK & Japanese style curry mee tai mak served with quail egg, tendon, tripe, fukujinzuke and homemade fermented chili. The beef is almost melt in mouth and further elevated with chilli that is aromatic and packed with punch.

Morsels Restaurant & Gastro Wine Bar | Morsels Private Dining,L Y,"2024.10.26 (Sat)
Morsels is a quaint little restaurant tucked away in an obscure corner of Dempsey, away from the hustle and bustle. The setting reminds me of a manger/barn. Unassuming. The services from Fai and Poh Lin are very earnest and authentic.

The culinary offerings has its fair share of hits (more) and misses (less). It‚Äôs also an acquired taste because of the fermented sauces the chef likes experimenting on. I deliberately avoided the beef ragu because I received rather disappointed feedback from my family members who tried it.

Snack: was a prawn broth with cracker. I really didn‚Äôt fancy the prawn broth. The cracker was ok.

Appetiser:
Hokkaido Scallop carpaccio 7/10
Whipped Burrata Kale Salad 9/10

Mains:
Catch of the week : Barramundi 9/10
Noodle of the week: Fisherman Assam seafood Noodles 7/10 - the fish is way overcooked. I liked how the prawn was grilled with flat sole fish before added into the soup. This is a fusion take of Assam noodles. It‚Äôs an acquired taste.

Dessert:
Hojicha panna cotta 10/10 - not too sweet ‚Ä¶ it just hits ALL the right notes. Considering I am not a dessert person!

My family tells me the tiramisu is excellent too.

Ambience:
I really love how wine corks are being recycled as chopsticks stands and shells being recycled as a napkin weight.

Morsels Restaurant & Gastro Wine Bar | Morsels Private Dining,Winston Lee,"Morsels is tucked in one corner of Dempsey, with a quaint and rustic ambience.
The $50 set lunch is definitely worth a try. Hokkaido scallop carpaccio had a just right balance of acidity and umami while the Primrose farm pork belly was succulent and tender without being overwhelmed by fat.
The duck dumplings were tasty enough but not in the same league as the scallops or the pork belly.
Fermented tomato fruit jus gave a nice tangy flavour to the thread fin.
Service from Pauline was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

The resturant itself is rustic and small but cozy, this I would say the best resturant design in Dempsy.

Fusion Korean, Japanese,  Singapore cuisine.  Ingredients are imported from Korea and Japan.

The olive butter with multi grain bread, sounds simple but is amazing.. is a must.

Had scallop ceviche, jeju abalone porridge, Iberico grill pork in kimchi.

Portion is ideal, flavour is unique,  food is made out of passion.

The manager Hazel made sure to infect us with her joy and positive vibes.
She brought warmth to the dim & cosy ambience of the restaurant.

We came as 2 pax and tried their Omakase Set for $128++ per pax and was pleasantly surprise.
What I love the most is that the set wasn‚Äôt rigid and set in stone.
We could choose our mains and sides.
The desserts were also a perfect ending to the dining experience.
I had the Scallop angel hair pasta. The 3 x scallops were HUGE and super fresh. There was uni on top of 1 of the scallop and truffle bits on every part of the dish.
Next, I got their Australian Wagyu steak and it was tender yet super flavourful‚Ä¶
For desserts I got their chocolate cake and it was wonderfully paired with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.

I tried their oysters out of curiosity and paid for it on top of the set and found that rather disappointing. Oysters weren‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù and had a bit of stench to it. A dish you can pass on.

R Italian Kitchen & Smokehouse (RUBATO),Renee Lim,"Visited for the first time during Valentine's day and it wasn't a great experience. Food was okay, but the service... OMG. I understand that it's a special occasion and the restaurant is trying to 'squeeze' the opportunity as much as possible, but it was bad!

Booked for 7.30pm dinner but the restaurant was so crowded that all people who reserved seats, waited outside in that already jam packed and narrow corridor, for another 20mins or so before getting in. Each table was only given 1hr to dine. Understaffed so service was slow, atmosphere was so hectic it feels like a warzone, (we saw another patron asking the waiter on the menu and said he rather get it himself) and yet the restaurant continues to take in reservations. We had a quick pasta and left in 45mins.

Food wise, we were quite mindblown by the cold angel-hair pasta with scallops. But other than that I don't think we'll be there again anytime soon.

Edited:
Service recovery was great! Went down on an afternoon for lunch to meet Hazel and the team and this time round we could enjoy the food and ambience so much more.

Odette,Yvonne Cheah,"Overpriced, Overhyped, and Utterly Underwhelming

I recently celebrated my birthday at Odette, a 3-Michelin-star restaurant that promised an unforgettable culinary journey. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing fine dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

We were seated right in front of the kitchen‚Äîa spot I initially thought would be interesting, but it offered no privacy. Staff constantly walked past us, and the seating arrangement (three round tables back-to-back) meant we could clearly hear the full conversations from the table behind us. This noisy, distracting environment was far from the refined ambiance expected at such an establishment.

As for the food‚Äîthe main event‚Äîit was surprisingly ordinary. Presentation was uninspired, flavors lacked depth, and the lighting at our table did nothing to enhance the visual appeal of the dishes.
‚Ä¢	Normandy Brown Crab ‚Äì Pretty to look at, but the avocado jelly was tasteless, and there was barely any crab meat.

Adding to the disappointment, we were handed jars of jam as parting gifts‚Äîwithout any mention that they needed refrigeration and should be consumed within two weeks. I only discovered this a month later, rendering them inedible.

Overall, Odette failed to deliver on its reputation. I expected innovation, bold flavors, and exquisite presentation, but the experience felt safe, uninspired, and overpriced.

Odette,MJ,"My boyfriend arranged a late birthday celebration for me at Odette, and it was truly special. It was my first time dining at a 3-star Michelin restaurant, and the experience definitely lived up to the reputation.

We had the course meal with wine pairing. While we generally prefer red wine, the staff did a wonderful job accommodating that preference, even though the menu leaned more toward seafood‚Äîwhich typically pairs better with white. They found a thoughtful balance that allowed us to enjoy some reds too, which we really appreciated.

The service was excellent‚Äîgenuine and attentive. It didn‚Äôt feel like they were just going through the motions; you can tell they truly care about the experience they‚Äôre giving their guests.

The food had a very homey, nostalgic feel to it. Each dish brought a sense of comfort, which is rare at fine dining establishments. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôll remember for a long time.

All in all, a beautiful evening and a truly 3-star experience.

Odette,Raphael Revindran,"Quite possibly the worst dining experience I've ever had. From the lukewarm reception to the lacklustre courses, one struggles to find the slightest semblance of a redeeming quality for this ""priceless jewel"", as dubbed by the powers that be behind the Michelin guide.

In fact, its presence on the roster calls all other entries into contention, notwithstanding that our visits elsewhere were delightful, and this being the chief (and sole) offender.

There are many outfits which are pretentious, but they at least have the decency to match their air of superiority with an impressive gastronomic experience.

Odette was neither.

(1) Service & Ambience
We were seated in the main dining hall. If you prefer a modicum of privacy while you try to make justifications for this sorry excuse of a meal, well, unfortunately, you would be fresh out of luck.

When we were not making awkward eye contact with patrons seated across from us, we were treated to an incessant, unrefined flurry of staff who simply could not remain out of sight. To top it off, we had the great fortune to be seated where the entire kitchen could gawk at us throughout the meal while the ‚Äúopen kitchen‚Äù barely provided vision of kitchen activity.

The entire atmosphere was distracting, intrusive and highly uncomfortable.

(2) Presentation
Plating was boring, the very limited finesse present was contrived, and there was a severe lack of performative entrances.

(3) Culinary
- Grignotages: Flavours were very muted. Nothing spectacular.
- Mushroom ‚ÄúTea‚Äù and Brioche: Appetising and earthy. Quite possibly the best dish Odette has to offer.
- Normandy Brown Crab: A complete blank. Zero flavour and there was hardly any crab.
- Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg: Laughable. For all its fanfare, it tasted barely a notch above a soft-boiled egg made at home.
- Langoustine ‚ÄòComme un Dumpling‚Äô: Supplement $98, but hold the flavour. Truffles were either not properly stored or of a low quality, as they had no aroma at all. Langoustine was tasteless.
- Seaweed Butter Poached Scallop: Decent presentation and flavours, but I am being generous here. Very forgettable.
- Aveyron Lamb Saddle: A very sad lamb dish. The texture was completely off (tough, wrong mouthfeel), and its flavour was overly gamey with no depth.
- ‚ÄòIspahan‚Äô Vacherin: A tribute to‚Ä¶ sad ice cream and sickeningly sweet artificial rose syrup? When I thought it could not get any worse, the server cleared our relatively untouched plates without bothering to ask how we found the dish. Come on.
- Douceurs: Looked sad, and tasted like it looked. Canel√©s were way too hard with barely any flavour, and seriously, cut fruits? Regardless of provenance, such a selection betrays laziness and incompetence.

(4) Value
No uni. No caviar. No foie gras. No high quality ingredients. Did I just pay a premium to be ogled at while I eat unimpressive and unimaginative food?

I am in no way saying those are obligatory inclusions, but when you can offer nothing else, at least soften the blow.

They say ‚Äúprice is what you pay, value is what you get‚Äù. Well, at Odette, the price is a four-figure sum, and the value is an inside joke ""at least it's better than Odette"", that I can make reference to every single time I have a substandard meal.

Pathetic.

##

I will not even deign to discuss elements such as complexity and synergy, as the individual flavours (or lack thereof) were either too muted or completely missed the mark.

In summary, dining at Odette was a lesson in mediocrity.

The food did not even taste bad, which makes it worse ‚Äì because what that means is, it's not that Odette isn't trying, or that the crew has no formal training. Odette is pulling out all the stops, only to arrive at this utterly forgettable and pedestrian experience. Disappointing and embarrassing.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Odette/@1.3548586,103.686695,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a74fed486d:0x32964a71907ce024!8m2!3d1.2897067!4d103.8514433!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEWZmluZV9kaW5pbmdfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVSM2JXOXliMmRCUlJBQqoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAhXEDI!16s%2Fg%2F11bwn8t504"
Odette,Genta,"Dining at Odette was truly one of the most unforgettable culinary experiences of my life.

From the moment I stepped inside, I knew I was in for something special. The ambiance is immaculate‚Äîelegant and refined without ever feeling stiff or pretentious. It has that perfect balance of warmth and upscale sophistication, the kind of place that instantly makes you feel like you‚Äôre somewhere extraordinary.

The service was nothing short of impeccable. It was intuitive in a way that felt almost magical‚Äîthey knew what I needed before I even had to ask. Every interaction was gentle, thoughtful, and gracefully unobtrusive. It made the entire experience feel seamless, almost like the restaurant was choreographing a dance that I was simply invited to enjoy.

And then, there‚Äôs Chef Julien Royer. What an absolute angel. He came out to speak to the guests with the warmest, kindest energy‚Äîno ego, just genuine passion and hospitality. I even got the chance to peek into his kitchen and snap a couple of photos with him, which honestly felt like meeting a culinary rockstar. You can feel how much love he pours into everything.

Now, the food. Mindblowing doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe it. Each dish was a journey‚Äîvisually stunning, technically flawless, and emotionally resonant. The concept, execution, and ingredients were all at the highest level, but what truly impressed me was how harmonious everything felt. Nothing was done for show‚Äîevery element had purpose, texture, depth, and soul.

The highlights of the menu included:

Marukyo Uni with Red Sicilian prawn, mussel cloud, and Kristal caviar‚Äîa luxurious burst of oceanic flavor and incredible texture

Normandy Brown Crab with avocado, nashi pear, and coriander‚Äîfresh, light, and beautifully balanced

The iconic Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg, paired with smoked potato syphon and chorizo Iberico‚Äîwarm, comforting, and rich with umami

Scottish Blue Lobster with Kyoto miso, endive, and sak√© beurre blanc‚Äîperfectly cooked and bursting with delicate sweetness

Kombu Steamed Kinki served with squid, Obsiblue prawn consomm√©, and sudachi‚Äîelegant, clean, and deeply satisfying

Kampot Pepper Crusted Pigeon with Solli√®s figs, black garlic, and Piedmont hazelnut‚Äîa standout, complex yet balanced and full of character

A refined selection of artisan cheeses, perfectly ripened and presented

The Comice Pear ‚ÄòGourmandise‚Äô‚ÄîJerusalem artichoke, peanut, and Vanuatu vanilla‚Äîunexpected, thoughtful, and layered

And a beautiful interpretation of a French-style tiramisu/coffee dessert, which I believe was called ‚ÄúHigh Coffee‚Äù or something similar‚Äîcreamy, bold, and the perfect ending note

Every dish was plated with poetry and served with intention. The meal unfolded like a quiet narrative‚Äîsubtle at times, powerful at others, always unforgettable.

Odette is more than a three Michelin-starred restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a place that feeds your soul while dazzling your senses. I walked away with a full heart, a deeper appreciation for food as art, and memories I‚Äôll carry forever.

Summer Palace,Ohayo Oreo,"I never had a bad lunch here. I was surprised to see so many 1 star rating for this restaurant that deserves good attention. I brought my cousin here to celebrate her 50th birthday in advance and as I'd reserved, we got a nice table by the window. Table was large yet comfortable for good interaction. I only want to order their Dim Sum as they are always good. However, they should dish out each dish slooooowwwwer. Yes we did ask to bring food out when they are ready, but not all at one go right? :) since dim sum is best to eat while is pipping hot.

I enjoyed every dish and they even have amuse bouche to start and end with some cute tasty dessert. They were also so nice to bring out a special dessert platter for my cousin's 50th birthday.
This small gesture makes me want to go back more often! I just forgotten about them since there are too many restaurants in Singapore.

The lady who first attended to us, Jennie, is very knowledgeable about the selection of teas and even told us how the tea leaves are made. We followed her recommendations for a pu-er and were not disappointed. Her recommendations for the dim sum selection was also spot on.

Our second server, Alwin, is also a jovial chap and what impressed me was that he noticed my partner was left handed and even rotated the plate to cater to him. Such attention to detail is top notch and very few restaurants I have been to can boast of such staff. When my partner had a sneezing phase and had to go to the bathroom, he automatically told me that he would change my partner‚Äôs napkin to a new one.

Food was also impressive and delicious. Our tea pot was constantly looked after and they made sure our pu-er was not too thick or too thin. Food presentation and taste (chef kiss). I would come back here even just for the dim sum.

Summer Palace,Gaius Leong,"Visited on 24 May 2025 for lunch.

Whole Peking duck with 2nd course was great. Though the fried corn cracker was too oily tasting and crepe felt thick pancakes and didn't go well with the perfect duck.

Dim sum was good with the exception that Siew Mai was a bit funny tasting - filling was too compacted to taste natural. Lobster was outstanding. Portions and size of each dim sum (comes in threes) were actually surprisingly big.

Price was generally high and i don't find it warranted. We would probably only return for the dim sums during lunch.

Service was a bit slow but it had a very classy feel. Almost butler style. But our tea was not refilled or poured regularly. Some staff could not speak good English, so I had a hard time translating with my friends.

Tea selection was wide but we had no way of knowing what was good for us. Perhaps there could be a sample tea tray for guests to sniff or see the teas before making a more informed choice. We just went for Ju Pu because we had no clue what anything could drink like.

Hilton honors members dine with 20-25% off.

Fried dried shrimp appetiser $10. Very worth it and so yummy! There's also a sparkling makoli that is so worth drinking, esp if you've never had it before. And it wasn't ex at $80 a bottle,  comparable to standard Prosecco's and cheaper than Champagne.

ANJU,Janet Chin,"First time at ANJU.

Food was great and I‚Äôm surprised by the portion. Thought the portion will be small so we ordered 6 dishes to be shared between 3 pax hahaha we were sooo full.

- Uni scallop was interesting - love the pickles and dill the most.
- Hogam Jeon - so crispy!! +3 bucks to add cheese but the cheese was kinda non existent hahaha
- cauliflower - can skip the sauce is more sweet than spicy.
- abalone seaweed pasta - nice and the seafood taste is stronggggg. Abalone was QQ and tender.
- bossam - the meat melts in your mouth but is it really worth 50 bucks‚Ä¶? Idk but it‚Äôs pretty good HAHAHA
- maekgeolli panna cotta - my favourite dish out of everything I ate. The maekgeolli taste is strong but the alcohol taste balance off with the sweet melon and popping candy.

ANJU,UnpopOpinions,"This is such an average restaurant, tried all the famous dishes, the cauliflower is just sweet and sour hard coated and really didn‚Äôt match all other high rating reviews‚Äô descriptions. The taste is just overpowering sweet and sour sauce you get from Chinese restaurants in western countries, the mini‚Äùrice cakes‚Äù is soaked with only vinegar that makes your face squeeze.

Potato pancake is like some cheap version of rice cracker snacks with a few pieces of zucchini on 40% of the potato slices, which was hard on first bite and soggy after dipping their vinegary sauce.

Main abalone dish, which really is just a cold angel hair noodle (they should have put it in cold section, not main) took over 40mins to get ready and the taste is just, average, for about 40bucks.

I noticed it‚Äôs mainly locals (including the staff) that dine and serve here, so really it has nothing much to do with Korean. At best i would say it‚Äôs an attempt to go into the fine direction from but really just form over essence (even form not so much). We wanted to order more initially if the food was good, after trying all the popular dishes we simply just didn‚Äôt bother to order,despite staffs multiple times of ‚Äúlast order call‚Äù to us.

Their eagerness to try and find out what we think about the food/how did we discover them/asks us to order more etc. somehow hints to me that they know the food is average. Perhaps the good reviews are sponsored too

I hope more people will develop a good sense of taste so that only the good restaurants get supported. Anju is apparently overrated IMO. There are plenty of good restaurants at that area.

My friends also got diarrhoea after this.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/ANJU/@1.3548586,103.686695,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da191e621b0195:0xcdfdcdba5fbb630a!8m2!3d1.2778061!4d103.8442373!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERa29yZWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUlVMV1p4ZDNGblJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIbxBK!16s%2Fg%2F11n0n78h6b"
ANJU,Chewielicious T,"Highly do not recommend this restaurant for special occasions ü§Ø

The food is consistently good, but the service leaves much to be desired. I went with my girlfriends for a farewell dinner before one of them returned to her home country, and the entire experience felt rushed. We were barely starting our mains when the staff came over and asked us to order dessert as it was the last call. To make matters worse, the check arrived with the dessert, and we were told we needed to leave in five minutes. This felt completely unreasonable.

While we understand the two-hour dining limit, the speed at which the food was served didn‚Äôt match the time allotted, leaving us to rush through our meal. I shared this feedback with the server, who said she would pass it along to management, but when she walked by again, she avoided eye contact. The lack of professionalism was disappointing.

If you scroll down to read the reviews, seems to have many people giving feedback about the rushed experience.

ANJU,Chua Bernard,"Had a memorable dining experience in this Chic Restaurants some time ago, that serve exquisite comtemporary korean cuisines. We ordered the following dishes during our visit.

-Galbi Jjim .. Slow-braised beef short ribs were tender and bathed in soy-garlic reduction. The sauce was deeply savoury with hint of sweetness and balanced by the warmth of ginger as well as toasted sesame seeds. Cut Mushrooms, Carrots and Daikon soaked up the braising liquid like sponges, adding earthy depth to each bite. Finished with a scattering of scallions and sesame seeds for brightness and crunch. It was really a deep flavoured and well textured dish.

-Yangnyeom Cauliflower .. was not only visually appealling but also a bold, flavour-packed twist on classic Korean Fried Chicken. Each floret was well battered and fried till Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, then coated in a sticky, spicy-sweet gochujang sauce, and garnished with rice cake, caramelized sesame seeds and cut green chilli. I would consider it a good vegetarian dish using cauliflower as substitute for chicken meat.

-Hogam Jeon .. What they serve here wasn‚Äôt a average Jeon but a next-level combo of sweet, savoury and cheezy. The soft, naturally sweet mix of Potato, Zucchini and Onion Pickle paired well with juicy prawns and gooey Mozzarella. Pan-fried to a golden brown crisp, each bite was melty, rich, comforting and full of flavours.

-Sweet Potato (Ice Cream Dessert) .. Was creamy and full of cozy and earthy sweetness. The Salted Caramel Creme added a rich, buttery swirl while the Brown Butter Crimbie brought the perfect crunch. The roasted sweet potato skin powder gave a subtle, roasty finish and could have tied the whole dessert together, if not for the Charcoal Curd Foam that was abit too smoky for my liking.

Overall, we loved all the three dishes that were served, except for the dessert, even though we did not paired them to drinks (Alcohol) as suggested.

The Ambience of the restaurant was rather cosy with the modern decorations and lightings, but can get a little noisy when fully filled with patrons.

Food: the tom yum pasta was great. The spiciness is customizable, which adjusts the amount of chilli padi. We tried the 'bit more spicy' version and it was just about right. The aglio olio was sinfully good as well, on the oily side.

Service: After seating, order and pay at the counter before being served. Food came relatively quick.

Godmama at Funan - Modern Peranakan Restaurant Singapore,Sim Simon,"In the context of Asian cuisines and esp. in comparison with Chinese, Japanese or Korean foods, (often considered as ""mainstream"" locally), we have often thought peranakan food as niche, 'atas' and pricey. However, after a recent visit to Godmama, we have totally changed our erroneous initial perceptions on all counts.
The food there was indeed highly delicious, and their pricing rather pocket-friendly!
Staff were helpful, meticulous and attentive to all our cues and dining needs.

Colony,Chris,"First time trying this place, recommended by friends. We purposely came on Friday night where they served seafood buffet. Understand Sun-Thurs may have some 15% discount for certain credit cards, but no discount on Fri and Sat.

Basically, there are 3 main section of food, the desserts, the cold dishes and the cooked food (together with fruit juices and fruits).

I must say the selection of food is great, but considering the price per pax vs quality , I give it a 4-star only. Some of the food item is quite disappointing, such as the lobsters, al of us concluded the sauce taste funny, and we had to specially asked for it without sauce. The oysters and crabs are fresh though.

The environment is nice and cosy, but t think they placed too many tables, resulting the walkway between tables are narrow and can be dangerous when you move with hands full of food. I give it a 4-star.

The staff are friendly and helpful but they lack of some product knowledge, and we had some
Hard time checking on discounts, and almost needed to avoid our payment. 3 of us paid for $425

We ordered quite a few dishes with the highlights being their Umami Prawn Rice - texture and flavours were very well balanced. Hokkaido Scallop Crudo -quality scallop and refreshing, presentation was spot on.

We went in a little late, so placed order slightly after last order. Staff were really accommodating and attentive to our request.

The ambience was really nice and cosy, very well decorated. Good for taking Instagram pictures!!

Marcy's,Peh Conglin,"A Dining Experience to Remember

From the very first bite, this restaurant delivered a symphony of flavors that left us completely in awe. We began our evening with the Brussels sprouts and Hokkaido scallops‚Äîan exquisite opening act that set the tone for what would become an unforgettable meal.

We then indulged in a variety of mains to share: both pasta dishes, the rice, the pork chop, and the seasonal fish. Each dish was a masterclass in culinary artistry, but the standout was undoubtedly the sole fish. Smoky, savory, with a subtle tang that lingered beautifully on the palate‚Äîit had a texture so delicate and meaty, I could have sworn I was eating perfectly cooked white meat. It genuinely blew our minds and sparked an excited conversation about how the chefs managed to craft such deep, complex flavors with such finesse.

To finish, we shared the pecan ice cream and the chocolate cake‚Äîboth rich, comforting, and satisfying. As a heartwarming surprise, the team brought out a chocolate brownie to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday, a thoughtful gesture that perfectly captured the warmth of the evening.

Special thanks to waitress Jo for her kind and attentive service, and to Chef Yu Hui for the phenomenal meal that made us feel completely at home.

A-Poh Kitchen,I W,"My family wasn't feeling particularly hungry, and we decided to go to A-Poh Kitchen for dinner, a place we hadn't been to for several years.

This is basically a halal chinese restaurant.  I am perfectly fine with eating chinese food in a halal restaurant provided there is no compromise to the taste of the food.

Am happy to say that the food at A-Poh Kitchen is very good.  I ordered beef chye sim, salted egg sotong, and  oyster omelette, with one plate of rice to be shared among the three of us.

The waitress who took our order (a middle aged chinese lady) had the presence of mind to serve the plate of rice together with another two empty plates even though we did not ask for the empty plates nor indicate to her that the three of us wanted to share one plate of rice.  This may seem to be a small thing, but nowadays, common sense isn't that common.  So kudos to our waitress.

For me, the star of the show is the salted egg sotong. I muttered ""wow"" in my mind whilst eating it.  There was a very generous coating of salted egg on the sotong, such that when you take a bite, you might initially think you are biting into a salted egg pastry, except that a few joyous seconds later, your taste buds tell you that it is not pastry but sotong that is in your mouth.

We ought to come back more often.

Fourgather Thai Casual Dining (Telok Ayer Branch),Low Wee HENG,"We were here for lunch on a Monday and it was very crowded! It was obvious that it was a very popular place, and I can understand why!

I feel there's quite a bit of a modern touch to the Thai food they serve. They taste authentic, but not boring. One of the dishes had a very funny name: Son-in-law eggs.

The vibe inside was comfortable and nice. It is suitable for big and small groups, so it is perfect for a work lunch.

The Summerhouse,Victoria Lee,"Went to summerhouse on 26 July to help my friend for his surprise proposal. Definitely was not expected to be ‚Äòtold off‚Äô by one of the service crew during the process. Booking of the dome was not done by me but by my friend (the groom to be). He has requested to Summerhouse for the dome to be opened earlier as there were decorations to be set up and his intention to propose before dinner service starts at 6pm. This was agreed by Summerhouse that we can have the dome at 5pm. Closer to the proposal time, the service crew started coming in to place bottled waters and was preparing to set up the table. I had to ask them to come back later as my friend was coming into the dome and a video recording was in process. The next moment, the manager (I assumed) came inside the dome and told me off for asking his staff to come back later and how they are running a tight schedule to get everything ready on time. While I completely understand how F&B crew has it tough and the stress level is high at meal time, we specifically told Summerhouse to give us the dome earlier for the proposal purpose. If that was communicated, shouldn‚Äôt the table be pre set up  before we came? Perhaps there were some areas of miscommunication between both sides but it certainly leave a bad experience to an otherwise joyful occasion, especially when I am here to just witness my friends get engaged and I was not even involved in the reservation of the dome. The manager eventually left when he understood a proposal was in progress but I wish he communicated in a nicer tone.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Summerhouse/@1.3548586,103.686695,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da15d32c2cbafb:0x439659cc6b10a1c3!8m2!3d1.4079871!4d103.8683134!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSMWJYVlVXalJSUlJBQqoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAEEY!16s%2Fg%2F11c2pdn9yb"

From an earlier visit:
Enjoyed the roast duck, roast pork and char siew. The har kau was ok. Wasn‚Äôt impressed with the siew mai and XO sauce turnip cake. Enjoyed the 10-head abalone with foie gras. Enjoyed the scallops with asparagus and fungus but felt that the scallops could be larger for the price of the dish. The Chinese cabbage dish was not bad but could have more vegetables and less tang hoon. The pork and raw egg hor fun was not bad but I didn‚Äôt get any pork in my bowl. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the chilled mango sago too much. Perhaps the dish doesn‚Äôt go too well with the peach resin and could do with more sago and mango.

After ordering, the waitress asked for our membership. We were unsure of this requirement, and she said there was nothing she could do and just kept apologizing. Completely threw us off and spoilt the evening for our celebration. Yes, it was our mistake that we did not read the fine prints in the booking. But we cannot believe that all the confirmations, reminders, and even entering into the restaurant, we were not once informed to show the membership. The waitress did not even bother to follow up on my request to speak to her manager.

NOBU Singapore,Lina Ekarhani,"Purchased the Taste of Nobu Weekend Brunch KrisFlyer Experience and we had an absolutely fabulous time! From the get go the service was impeccable. We reached a few minutes before 11am and were told to wait at the bar first, but was immediately ushered in at 11am to our table. The server brought the menu and carefully explained what was included in our package.

Starting from the cold buffet, we tried their variety of sushi which was super fresh! My fave would be the yellowtail jalapeno, it wasn't spicy, but it had just enough kick to make your tongue dance. The seafood ceviche was nice too.

For the exclusive selection, we obviously choose the Lobster salad with spicy lemon dressing and toban yaki A5 wagyu beef. Usually we would be quite sceptical when ordering a lobster because the meat can be tough and too chewy. That wasn't the case here. It was so sweet and easy to bite. The spicy lemon dressing really compliment the lobster and make it a very refreshing dish.

The wagyu beef was just... A mah zing! üòç it definitely earn the spot as my no. 1 fave out of all the dishes we've tried. Served on a hotplate, it was a simple but cooked to perfection. The taste was so tender, rich, buttery, sweet and savoury all melt in your mouth.

By this time we were starting to get full, but lo and behold, we still have 12 more hot dishes to go! So we decided to just focused on the ones we wanted to try and skipped the rest.

The rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce is SO good. It was coated in sauce but when you bite into it, it was soo crispy. The sauce was on the heavy side that we ended up strugling to finish (but we did finished it ü§≠).

The 2 fish dishes: the black cod miso and umami chillean sea bass were really nice as well. I liked the black cod more than the sea bass because the sauce was sweeter, but my husband like the seabass more as it taste lighter compared to the black cod.

We didn't expect much of the seafood toban yaki and the josper charcoal grilled spring chicken, but we were pleasantly surprised. The chicken was really fragant and the skin has a nice crisp.

By this time our tummies were about to explode, but we can't bear to finish the brunch without trying the difference between F1 beef steak and F1 beef toban yaki. I can tell you for sure, always choose toban yaki style. The steak was a bit tough, but the toban yaki beef was sooo tender!  It was a nice closing dish to our brunch journey.

We did try the desserts, but I can't comment too much as we both are not desserts person and we thought the desserts was a tad too sweet for our taste. They were super cute tho!

Everything including the non-alcoholic drinks were already part of the package so we only paid $40 for the free flow of sake for hubby.

All in all we thouroughly enjoyed our dining experience in Nobu and 10 /10 will definitely go again when we get a chance ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/NOBU+Singapore/@1.2783104,103.6976219,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da199e9f9c7995:0x7ca1b7d79bd6d2f0!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19df4fc25675:0x49b5617142d72f6b!8m2!3d1.3051922!4d103.8284188!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSR016ZGlaVEZuUlJBQqoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAEC4!16s%2Fg%2F11rv7zrbrh"
NOBU Singapore,Johanna Chow,"Came here with the expectation that it will be a classy, sort of fine dining high end sushi place.

Definitely on the pricey side but you pay for the experience. Ambience was brilliant, cozy and intimate with the dim lighting and modern Japanese furnishings. Service and staff was impeccable. It was our first time and the servers were patient to explain the menu and give recommendations because we took some time to decide.

Love rice cakes with tuna and the soft shell crab maki! For the maki, it was interesting to note that on top of seaweed, they also rapped a thin slice of radish which gave a crunchy refreshing twist.

Salmon tacos seemed ordinary and portions were way too small even for the price point ($6 each I believe) so your money is better spent on other dishes. Beef was also not too bad, super umami and filled with savoury buttery flavour.

Overall, we would have preferred the portions to be a bit bigger for most dishes. We weren‚Äôt craving any dessert and asked for the bill but they surprised me with a free dessert on the house.

NOBU Singapore,Melvin J.,"Nobu at the Four Seasons Hotel offers a decent Japanese lunch buffet, though some dishes fell short of expectations. The scallops were a bit dry and lacked depth in flavour, while the sushi, though well-balanced with more fish and less rice, had slightly soggy rice. The buffet spread is modest in variety, but the mini chirashi stood out with its generous mix of ingredients. Desserts are delightfully sweet, perfect for those with a sweet tooth, and while the F1 steak was a tad tough, it was still enjoyable. The brinjal was a pleasant surprise, beautifully glazed with a rich sauce. Service was impeccable and the staff were warm and welcoming, which enhanced the dining experience. However, the experience was slightly marred by a kitchen staff member who seemed unhappy, shouting and then walking off.

NOBU Singapore,T T,"Weekend brunch buffet was fantastic and exceeded expectations given lacklustre ratings on Google, which we personally found was undeserved.

The cold buffet section, albeit a bit limited, is good quality and I really loved the guacamole, chips and sashimi section. Having said that, where this buffet shines is definitely the free flow hot food selections from their menu - the cod and steak in particular. That is where most of your stomach space should be saved for.

Pricey? Sure, but it‚Äôs Nobu and the quality was worth it, in our opinion. In terms of highlights - the miso black cod absolutely hit the spot although the third portion we ordered was fishier, we still loved it. The F1 Japanese beef came in 2 styles, toban (sizzling skillet) or steak, and we preferred the steak version as it was cleaner tasting and retained the melt-in-the-mouth texture.

Service was faultless - the young man attending to our table was great and unfortunately his name escapes me but he was professional, warm and attentive.

We had the Breizh Menu: 1 savoury crepe (ham, egg, cheese), 1 sweet crepe and a glass of apple cider. Also had the mushroom soup and the scallop appetisers.

Clean flavours, quality ingredients, yummy flavours.

My fave was the sweet crepe. Simply delicious!

The original crepe with flour is very thin and soft. Gluten-free crepe is thin and crispy, which I much prefer. Prices are on the higher side ($15-18+ per crepe) and if you're seated indoors, there's a minimum order of one crepe per person. Accepted payment are cash or PayNow/PayLah only.

The BOILER @ Buona Vista | Best Seafood Boil | Crabs & Lobsters |,Orrdii Tan,"[Jul 2025] Been to Boiler many times over the years across different outlets, the food and service never fail to deliver, be it for cosy date nights or large gatherings.

Tried the flavour of the month - laksa! (To Boiler, do consider making this a permanent flavour, it‚Äôs bombilicious!) The ingredients were completely coated with the rich and fragrant laksa sauce, especially the mantous.

Food was served fast. Note that the place and crowd may be a bit loud for babies and young children.

Had the medium duo bag with the sauce of the month. I would say it was pretty dang good though more buns would be great personally the seafood was pretty fresh especially the prawns though I wish it was more generous with the sausages and the corn as there were one piece each. And we ordered the Sri Lanka crab with garlic butter which was a lighter sauce and as well with their promo of 50% off which I don‚Äôt know if they did do the discount on the bill but! It was pretty good. And a little side we ordered was the wings those were honestly great with a nice crunch and to end it off we tried the lava cake which was nice with the side of ice cream as well.

Canopy Jurong Lake Gardens,Richard Tan,"Planned to take the family to check out Jurong Lake Gardens, and decided to plan dinner nearby as well - Canopy was recommended by Google.

Enquiry call: Couldn't figure out the parking situation from Google Maps, so I called in the afternoon. Staff who picked up the call was polite and helpful. Advised that the restaurant would be about a 10-15 minute walk from the car park. Noted.

Accessibility: Open-air car park is indeed located a 10-15 minute pleasant slow walk from the drop-off point. However do note that the last hurdle is the famous Chinese Garden arched bridge which is quite steep.

Ambience: We visited on a quiet Monday evening with only 3 other occupied tables. Nice and quiet with a couple of well-behaved kids present. Was told that there is a live band performing on Saturdays. Well noted. Vibe is very casual with greenery in birdcages hanging from the ceiling. Outdoor area is pet-friendly, and we passed two doggies on our way in.

Service: Very attentive, our server was observant and responsive when we needed to catch his eye. Helpful with dish customisation too. Nice touch to offer mum a cup of hot water. Thanks!

Food: Quite tasty and well-presented. Portion sizes were adequate. Had to wait a little while for our mains which was puzzling as the restaurant wasn't very busy.

Affordability: Menu prices are on the higher side, considering the standard and taste of the dishes we ordered, but well worth the vibe and locale. Good for a first date or for celebrating a family event, maybe not for our weekly meals.

Hint: Come a little earlier for dinner and go for a stroll behind the restaurant to see the stone boat, lotus pond and the pagoda in the distance. Well-maintained garden is a pleasure to wander through. Toilets are located a short walk outside the restaurant, visit before your meal.

Canopy Jurong Lake Gardens,Claudia Koh,"Dropped by on a public holiday for brunch! They had a free welcome lemon tea for oddle members which was nice and strong but a little too sweet.

Had their breakfast platter, which was kinda mid but not bad for the price $20. Though the menu said sourdough, the toast was just normal white bread/baguette. Kind of disappointing. Scrambled egg is abit dry and some bits was over done.

üêü Dive into the world of premium Giant Grouper over at Mr Johnny Tan's restaurant. One-of-its-kind, the fish weighs nearly a whopping 300kg! Priced for its rich, thick collagen, Johnny knows the best ways to bring out the freshness and unique taste of this delicacy with a stock simmered with loads of fresh fish. Another unique stock is made with Coconut Cotelydon that give the dishes a natural sweet taste.
Almost every part of the fish can be consumed, including its scales, which are used to make the nutrious Gui Ling Gao ÈæüËãìËÜè.
Apart from fish, Johnny sources special vegetables from the Saba aboriginals, such as Crystalline Ice Plant. It makes a perfect match with Coconut Cotelydon for a refreshing, crunchy delight.

Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this.

JAAN By Kirk Westaway,Melissa Koh,"We celebrated my husband‚Äôs 41st birthday at Jaan and it was a truly memorable experience. This was our third time dining here and our first visit since the restaurant's revamp‚Äîand I‚Äôm happy to say it‚Äôs just as exceptional as ever.

Each drink was thoughtfully crafted to mimic the experience of reds and sparkling wines‚Äîcreative, refreshing, and full of surprises.

A special shoutout to Jagan for the kind gesture of an additional scallop dish and a beautifully printed ‚ÄúHappy 41st Birthday‚Äù message, which made the celebration feel even more personal and special. A great recommendation by the sommelier to pair the cheese plate with Kopke port‚Äîit was spot on.

JAAN By Kirk Westaway,Avijeet Sen,"Visited in Jun 2024 for dinner.

The dinner menu was a ~12 course dining experience (incl. the starting bites) for S$388++. The starting courses were excellent, esp. the Goose Mousse and the Barbecue Scallop courses. Among the main courses, the trout and the lamb were the best ones according to me. While there were a couple of dishes which felt a bit ‚Äúlacking in flavour‚Äù to me, the overall experience of the savoury courses was good. For desserts, we could choose between a strawberry and a chocolate course - the chocolate one tasted better to me. At the end of the 12 courses, there also 4 petit fours which were good - the chocolate  petit four was top notch.

For drinks, we just went with some Krug champagne as this is a Krug Ambassador restaurant.

Service is fantastic here, as would be expected of a restaurant of this stature. The restaurant was kind to cater to some of the allergies our group had. At the end of the meal, they were also very gracious to give us some extra petit fours as we had really liked them.

Not easy to find parking lot if you are driving. Need to circle around for a while to get a lot especially so if it is a peak hour for meals.

They have shifted several locations - from CT Hub, to Tampines Mart Cloud Kitchen, and now currently in the Bukit Batok heartlands (9 min walk from Bukit Batok MRT). What remains constant is the lady boss' dedication to preparing unique and tasty allium-free vegetarian food! Apart from more conventional Chinese dishes, they also serve Western, Nyonya, and Indonesian dishes. Previously had their CNY 2024 edition of their Indonesian Nasi Tumpeng, and some of their signature items such as Homemade Spicy Otah and Boneless Chicken. This time, I also enjoyed more bestselling dishes such as Ayam Penyet, Buah Keluak, Vegan Oyster Omelette, and Grilled Stingray.

Toast Box (West Coast Plaza),Oshin Shukla,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND  ****

So, heard alot about this breakfast place called Toast Box and thought of finally trying it.. and guess what??!! guys I loved it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Location and Ambience:
well you can find its branches almost anywhere in Singapore. It is amongst those few eateries which I would strongly recommend people to visit mostly because of its interior and Ambience. This place has this grandiose look and as soon as you enter you feel fresh because of the pretty white walls and bright lightings.

Food:
Food is good. Although I haven't tried everything but I have tried few of them like peanut butter toast and coffee. I personally love the peanut butter here. it tastes creamy and fresh as if they have just made it.
Coffee is also good but keep in mind that the spoon given is for some reason and that is to stir(I didn't stir it once and had to have it as it is and later realized that the sugar was there and all I needed to do was stirüòÖüòú).

Service:
Its a self service eatery. So, you ll have to stand in the queue and as soon as you give your order you recieve your drink be it coffee or tea or milo anything but for the food like toast or anything else you will have to wait but not for long.

Cost:
Yes It is pocket friendly and that is the one of the major reasons why I loved it.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toast+Box+(West+Coast+Plaza)/@1.2975443,103.7273095,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1af22a1ec0b9:0xfbfa091219f30438!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1af1898da4df:0xd0a0aefef7b1b05c!8m2!3d1.3034793!4d103.7655198!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgELY29mZmVlX3Nob3CaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUnRkRFZIY2w5QlJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABAe!16s%2Fg%2F12lkq1yc9"

Z√©n,Kelvin Goh,"We had a fantastic enjoyable lunch experience at Z√©n restaurant.

Once you enter the restaurant, you feel the three-star Michelin star atmosphere right away. The fabrics on the furniture look like art. The decor is kinda fun and energetic, creates that pre meal atmosphere, to ease you in and make you relaxed. Even the coaster for the water is pretty fancy.

We were served canapes.
First was a cannoli looking thingy, choux pastry filled with cream, and chestnut honey coating. Nice crunch.
Second was a tartlet with turnip base and marron crayfish and Thai basil. The crayfish had a nice bite and was so fresh, taste of the ocean.
Third was Tofu Yuba deep fried skin used as a tartlet base, bottom of tart is burrata cheese, with otoro and grilled pomelo with hint of wasabi. The otoro melts in your mouth.
Fourth was beignet with hazelnut mousse. that will ooze out. Eaten with one bite. The saltiness of the caviar and sweetness of the hazelnut mousse blends well together.

The staff explained all the ingredients they had used for the lunch experience. Pretty cool that they show you all the unique ingredients and sourced from where. So when we taste the dishes later on, we know what we are eating. E.g. the rhubarb is especially red and thick unlike the fainter and thinner ones we typically find in the supermarket. The grapes are so plump and glossy too.

We were then brought upstairs. Cool decor again, with the plants and sunlight.

First proper dish - Crudo: Scallop, artichoke, Amalfi lemon, galangal. The scallop was sliced so thinly and evenly, must have taken a lot of skill to do that. Below that was a thin layer of gel sheet thingy, and below that were small cubes of (I think it's artichoke). Very beautiful presentation with the thin strips of lemon, galangal.

Second dish - Chawanmushi awabi foie gras, matsutake. The mushrooms gave a very nice bite and meaty feel. It's really an immersive dining experience with the staff plating the dish in front of you.

Third dish - Madai, mussel, saffron, salted fennel. The fish melts in your mouth, but the blue mussel had a somewhat muddy taste.

Fourth dish - Onion, almond & liquorice. onion soup reduction, almond milk, almond oil, with real almonds for crunch, & liquorice powder. Our favourite dish! The almond milk and oil goes so well with the onion soup reduction, and the almonds provided good texture.

We were then presented knives from Sweden. hand painted. Birchwood. we can choose our knife to use for the main course

Fifth dish - Kurobuta pork, cabbage eescabeche', Kampot pepper, nori. YM had the same dish but was A4 Yukimuro wagyu instead of the Kurobuta pork. The fried kale was so good and the sauce was yummy.

Sixth dish - palate cleanser. rhubarb sorbet with strawberry granita and pink peppercorn. The rhubarb and strawberry was so good. But think the pink peppercorn was a bit overpowering.

Seventh dish - Sweet potato ice cream,grilled pineapple, mezcal (like tequila with smokey flavour that matches grilled pineapple) made into caramel sauce with anise mousse. Everything goes well together so nicely. And it was fantastic we got to see the pineapple ingredient and the whole roasted pineapple, and finally the immaculately arranged pineapple (like scales) on the plate.

Lastly we were brought to the third floor. Huge collection of wines and liquors. Nice comfy sofas and book collection. Meant to make you feel relaxed to enjoy the last desserts of the meal.

Trio of fruits in a very elegant dish - eat the grapes first (skin removed!) with soaked lemongrass water, followed by mango with Yuzu powder, and finally the super sweet melon!

Then we had a bowl of madeleines with brown butter. so fragrant! The staff kindly offered a second bowl! So yummy when it is so fluffy and warm.

The staff served us an entremet cake to celebrate birthday. The layers were so defined, and can see many vanilla specks in the mousse. So satisfying!

The staff showed us the balcony, nice view!

All in all, a very enjoyable experience.

Soup was excellent can taste how concentrated it was. But asked for abalone to be changed to fish maw and scallops.

Deep fried prawns were gigantic, crispy and tasted great. Were because there were two prawns.

Grand Shanghai Restaurant,V,"Disappointing First Visit to Grand Shanghai Restaurant in Singapore

I recently had the opportunity to dine at Grand Shanghai Restaurant in Singapore, and I must say that my first visit left me feeling rather disappointed. While the restaurant had been recommended to me by a friend, my experience fell far short of my expectations.

Pros:

Ambience: The restaurant's ambience was pleasant, with traditional Chinese decor that added a touch of elegance to the dining experience.

Chinese Cuisine Variety: Grand Shanghai offers a wide range of Chinese dishes, promising an extensive selection of flavours and culinary experiences.

Cons:

Unwelcoming Reception: My visit began on the wrong foot when the front desk Chinese lady did not make any effort to guide me to my reserved table, even though it was my first time there. This lack of attention made me feel unwelcome and lost.

Inconsistent Service: As our food was served, I noticed that some guests at adjacent tables were left waiting for their orders. It was disappointing to witness the lack of consistency in serving the food promptly to all customers. We had to repeatedly call over the waitress to remind them to serve the missing portions, which disrupted our dining experience.

Lack of Attention: The waitstaff's attentiveness was notably lacking throughout the evening. For instance, they failed to refill the teapot with hot water, even when we turned the lid upside down as a signal. This neglect of basic service elements hindered our enjoyment of the meal.

In conclusion, my first visit to Grand Shanghai Restaurant in Singapore was not as enjoyable as I had hoped. The restaurant's beautiful decor and variety of Chinese dishes are overshadowed by the unwelcoming reception, inconsistent service, and a lack of attention from the waitstaff. While the potential is there, there is significant room for improvement in customer service and attentiveness to ensure a more pleasant dining experience for guests.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Shanghai+Restaurant/@1.2794687,103.8043118,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da199d7f97cf9b:0x37a9e4a37fbc0aff!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da199d135ed917:0xc3b6b1e4b91de1e2!8m2!3d1.2896087!4d103.8358913!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU15Y1U4dGRXUm5FQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABAq!16s%2Fg%2F1tfd9zy1"

It‚Äôs been a long time since I visited Soup Restaurant (it‚Äôs usually hard to get a seat!), but after taking the first bite of the signature Samsui Ginger Chicken, I realised how much I missed it. ALL the dishes were so delicious‚Äîjust like how I remembered it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Special shoutout to Ah Moi, who took our orders. She was super warm, friendly, and patient with us‚Äîeven gave us great recommendations and helped us enjoy the best discounts. In a world full of QR code ordering, it was so refreshing to still have someone take our orders personally. Please don‚Äôt ever switch to digital-only‚Äîit makes a huge difference!

Also want to thank Yan Fei and Michelle, who were equally friendly and provided amazing service.

Great food, great people, and a really memorable celebration.

Soup Restaurant @ Holland Village,W.M. LIEW,Decent Chinese restaurant serving local dishes from a bygone era.. Food that would have been very familiar to my mom and granny.. Not that many places serves steamed mince pork patties nowadays or their famous samsui chicken which is basically steamed chicken. What makes Soup really tick for A Cantonese like myself is the double boiled soups (obviously)... Rarity nowadays as most modern families and/or the younger folks just either hv no time or knowledge how to make these stuff anymore. So good to have a place that can prepare it in single portions for those sopu deprived souls.,4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soup+Restaurant+@+Holland+Village/@1.3105313,103.7600848,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1a6b039d1a8d:0x39ad8aca1f0066ff!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a6b04764ba5:0x1b02a2a85f648c06!8m2!3d1.3105313!4d103.7961337!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEUY2FudG9uZXNlX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTnVObHBNZW5kUlJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABA-!16s%2Fg%2F11c59tvr39"

OCEAN Restaurant,Wen Fang,"I ordered the 4 course lunch menu and was blown away by the incredible food, service, and atmosphere.

I can't applaud the staff enough on how professional and friendly they were. I had the lovely May explaining each dish to me and making sure everything was going ok. There was also a group of diners at the table next to me making a lot of noise and crowding the tank to take selfies, so the staff kindly shifted them to the other end of the restaurant to allow me to enjoy observing the fish in the tank in peace - I was blown away by their kindness and consideration!

I was impressed with each course that came out. In addition to the menu items, there were also several complimentary hors d'oeuvres and desserts.

Each dish was expertly cooked, and each ingredient was extremely high quality and treated with utmost respect. As I had arrived at the restaurant just after it opened, I was shown a smoked duck neck the chefs had prepared for one of the hors d'oeuvres, as part of the restaurant's ethos to minimise wastage.

The Hokkaido scallop was large, plump, sweet, and had a buttery texture. The morello mushrooms had an amazing umami flavour and juicy beefy texture, I could have easily eaten a whole bowl of these. The white asparagus was tender and sweet, with no fibrousness at all. The sauces were also packed with flavour and complimented the dish wonderfully. A faultless dish!

The turbot was fall apart tender, as was the cabbage. The sauce also packed a lot of umami flavour which helped bring out the seafood flavour of the fish. The pickled shallots provided an acidity needed to balance the dish, and the tobiko provided some nice crunch as well to contrast the with the softness of the fish and cabbage.

The magret was cooked excellently, the fat had been rendered from the skin and the meat was blushing pink. I really enjoyed the toasted hazelnut garnish on the magret. The grilled orange provided a nice sweetness to combat the bitterness from the endive - which was cooked until it had a lovely soft texture. The only thing I noted was the toasted coriander seeds on top of the magret were a little bit too chunky, but I can imagine it would complement the magret nicely if it was ground down a bit more finely.

The dessert was very nice as well, the passionfruit jelly was very bright on the palette and packed with flavour. The pavlova was crisp and light, and the coconut jelly provided a good creaminess, along with the cream filling of the pavlova. The crispy rice was light and indeed crunchy, and had been coated in caramelised sugar which provided the slight bitterness needed to counteract the sweetness from the rest of the dish. I loved the addition of the lime zest sprinkled over the top of the dish. The only thing I noted was that the flavour of the mango sorbet was a little too subtle.

The complimentary bread was another unexpected highlight. I especially enjoyed the brioche and comte cheese bread. The brioche was crisp on the outside but light, fluffy, and buttery on the outside - i've never had anything like it before! The flavour of the comte cheese bread shone when eaten with the butter and honey.

The hazelnut dessert was also very delicious, the pastry tasted like a choux bun and it had a light chocolate/hazelnut creme filling inside which left a very clean mouthfeel afterwards.

Overall i'm very impressed with this restaurant and hope to come back the next time i'm in Singapore!

OCEAN Restaurant,S. K.,"Based on the previous reviews, I'd fully expected to only enjoy the view. However, we were pleasantly surprised that the food was actually really good. There were also some surprising elements that just elevated the dishes like the crispy prosciutto sprinkles. Just that the beef was really meh. Should stick to just seafood.
They accommodated our dietary requirements. Service was good. They also called a buggy to send us out where it's easier to get transport back to the mainland.

It was a beautiful experience dining with a view of the aquarium. However, I had called in weeks before to inform the staff that it was a birthday celebration, noted that we would have to purchase a cake directly from the restaurant. As it was a 6 course meal and only 2 diners, it would have been too much -  passed that option and requested for a simple ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù to be written on the dessert plate.

They allowed us to enjoy drinks on happy hour though we were using eatigo and service was brisk and friendly. Only dislike is that there's no AC even for indoors (mostly high chairs), we were seated outdoors thankfully it was nice and cooling under the fan. Can imagine it would be nicer for dinner. Generally we liked the food we ordered, especially secreto pork which was moist and tender. Complaints would be the paella is too salty and chicken in paella way too dry.

The Wharf,TH Tan,"We decided to try The Wharf last night for dinner and it left a bad taste in our mouths on two accounts:
1. Wait staff insisted that I had ordered beef beehoon soup instead of seafood when it was delivered. No problem, I was willing to consider that it may have been a miscommunication, and my toddler son was willing to eat it. But...
2. The wait staff asked for our credit card before preparing our order and retained the card (physically) throughout the duration of the meal.
We have never had this done to us anywhere, not even in fine dining restaurants in Switzerland. Moreover, I was not able to find this policy clearly posted or explained anywhere on the premises. One could, if so inclined, take this as a grave insult before even considering the possibility of misuse of the card.

The saving graces were the portion size and flavour, which were both decent for the price paid.

Riviera,Pat Yap,"Went for lunch with 2 acquaintances at Riviera Restaurant and coincidentally on a St. Valentine‚Äôs Day.  Because of this special day, they serve only the 4 Course Valentine‚Äôs Day set lunch menu.  The lunch came with artisanal bread with whipped butter.  The 1st course was the Hamachi Carpaccio - cured yellowtail fish loin with Kaluga Queen Caviar drizzled in yuzu ponzu, pickles and pistachio.  Quite refreshing and taste good.  Next, the Hokkaido Scallop served in sweet corn and cr√®me de persil and crispy chicken skin served in a stick.  The sweet corn and cr√®me go very well with the scallops! You could also dip the paper-like chicken skin into the cr√®me!  I love this dish because it‚Äôs so refreshing and I kept asking myself whether this is real chicken skin or not.  The 3rd course was the Australian Grass Fed Wagyu Beef with pomme puree and mustard sauce.  Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt ask me about the doneness I wanted for the beef.  Luckily it was not tough and was done appropriately.  It‚Äôs quite good actually.

Riviera,Desiree Bryan,"This restaurant has a great view for a special occasion and the the service was pretty good. -1 on service for rushing out food order while we were still looking at the wine list. They told us to start with food, which was odd. And, there was no course menu left at the table, which was unusual for a fine dining tasting menu.

Unfortunately, we just didn‚Äôt like the food. At all. We love Mediterranean food, especially French, and this food just had really odd flavors and combinations to us.

Here‚Äôs what we didn‚Äôt like:
-the tomato salad was out of season and very heavy on black pepper.
-they poured an awful and very spicy sauce over the lobster pastilla. It was called ‚Äúlobster bisque‚Äù but had the color and flavor of chili sauce. The inside of the pastilla was a very wet shredded vegetable. Sad because I love the original Moroccan pastilla.
-the fried artichoke with the wagyu tasted strongly of brine (from a tin).
-the roll with the cheese plate had an odd, fishy, taste. Might have been seaweed, but we just didn‚Äôt like it.
-the grapefruit and raspberry dessert was so, so tart it made your mouth pucker and had nothing rich to balance it.

I‚Äôd expect fresh, seasonal, produce and a strong understanding of how to balance flavors from a fine dining restaurant. This place is pretty, but mostly trades on the view.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Riviera/@1.286057,103.8180831,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da185311e1a28f:0xb6c5d1abb375a55e!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1908dfad29b1:0x650d89a92ab7a485!8m2!3d1.286057!4d103.854132!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEYbWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbl9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJDYkdaZlEyUlJFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQUIrgEQMg!16s%2Fg%2F1tdvgpjw"
Riviera,Fion,"Great view with great service.

Usually I don‚Äôt do reviews, but I would like to share my thoughts.

Husband planned for our anniversary at Riveria and initially I was worried if the menu would be unsuitable as I‚Äôm pregnant. Eg. No raw food/alcohol in food etc

However, the waiter was really nice and explained that the Chef will be able to accommodate to how I prefer it to be. Indeed, the Chef himself came personally to explain and ensure that all will be pregnancy-safe.

Really appreciate the thoughts and even though I may not enjoy the same as what my husband had, eg. Medium rare wagyu, scallop carpaccio, salmon roe, etc. The food was still yummy and we really enjoyed ourselves.

Thank you so much Riveria team, for making our anniversary a memorable one. The complimentary cake was really good too tho! Yums. And not forgetting the refreshing dessert we had in the end!

Morinaga Izakaya Restaurant Singapore („ÇÇ„Çä„Å™„Åå „Ç∑„É≥„Ç¨„Éù„Éº„É´ Â±ÖÈÖíÂ±ã),Matthew Lee,"Wow this place is really a ""hidden gem"" for me. Who would have visited a neglected mall in Orchard Road and would have found such a good izakaya hidden at the basement of the mall?
Saw this on social media and hence decided to pay a visit. When we arrived we were told the place is fully booked for the night for a weekend dinner and told us to call and make booking next time. However the place still looked pretty empty and I asked if we could do a quick dinner less than an hour and they said ok.
Was told since this place is an izakaya, there is a requirement for every diner to at least order an alcoholic drink. Not that I dont usually drink alcohol,  I said okay just for the sake of trying this place out.
They really have a wide selection of drinks and you have to keep flipping the menu to get to the food section. There's more small dishes than main dishes and also there's a wide variety of items we didn't know what to order, so other than some of the recommended dishes on social media, had to ask the staff for some recommendations.
First had the coriander bamboo. Its not a dish for those who dont like coriander but its definitely one of the very tasty dishes as the taste of the coriander really elevates the dish. The bamboo shoot tasted so good it felt like we were eating like clams or abalone you won't be able to know its bamboo shoot just by eating the dish.
Then we had the mentai mayo omelette. The portion was big for the price and was also tasty but I didn't like it that it was slightly on the wet side. The usual tamago in Japanese dishes is more dry which is one I'm more accustomed to.
The karaage was very big portion and value for money. Chicken was fried well and still managed to be juicy. The white radish complemented well and they were really generous with the white radish.
The truffle somen was pretty good, one of the mains we ordered. Its recommended to share this and not eat alone so could order more food to share.
The dish I enjoyed the most has to be the Hokkaido potato with butter and salted squid. I didn't expect the 2 ingredients to complement each other so well, its so nice I could eat a few servings.
Last but not the least though we were quite full, we decided to get the sashimi. Ordered a small one to share and the cuts were big and the fish was very fresh.
Was a very enjoyable meal and the price was quite reasonable.

Iggy's,The Closet Tenor,"I last visited Iggy‚Äôs years ago when it was still in a hidden corner of the Regent Hotel, when it was one of a mere handful of ambitious new eateries at the leading edge of what was to become Singapore‚Äôs contemporary fine-dining movement. Back then it was exciting, innovative, and remarkably unstuffy with its counter seating and close contact with the chefs.

At Voco, the interior design is still defined by a sleek, low-key sensibility (the main entrance is so well hidden, it looks like a side door); the chefs are now safely corralled behind a large glass window, and so the FOH now takes on the role of social contact, which they do well. Despite the fact that Iggy‚Äôs nowadays has to jostle elbows in an ever-burgeoning gastronomic food scene, the food has remained engaging and true to Iggy‚Äôs east-west DNA.

The ‚ÄúGastronomic‚Äù degustation menu is well-executed and beautifully plated, and consistently plays between the twin poles of French and Japanese cuisine. Pumpkin tofu, a Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, a salad of red Carabinero prawn, and a jap-influenced karasumi linguine were all delightful.

The stars, for me, were the 2 main courses: a longtooth grouper, and the Bresse pigeon. The longtooth, a firm white Japanese version of the familiar fish, was paired with duck confit and a duck-infused bourguignon sauce (!) which turned out to be an inspired combination. The pigeon, pink and tender, was exemplary. Iggy‚Äôs has a long tradition of playful pop culture-inspired desserts; the Rocky Road, a high-end interpretation of familiar carnival fare, went down well, as did its ‚Äúcorny‚Äù palate-cleansing predecessor.

The service was ever able, knowledgeable and warm.

Iggy's,Stephanie Loi-Watson,"Dining at Iggy‚Äôs at voco Orchard Singapore was a beautifully paced journey through refined flavors and seasonal Japanese ingredients with European finesse. The evening started with delicate snacks like shiro ebi and pumpkin tofu, easing into standout courses such as the Tennen Buri with caviar and shiso oil, and a silky Murasaki Uni dish featuring Hokkaido scallop and inaniwa udon. The King Crab with Japanese rice and crab miso was deeply comforting, while the Poulet de Bresse offered a classic yet elevated touch.

Wine pairing was thoughtful and actually complemented the meal well. A dessert wine pairing with the pudding (which needed more sweetness) would be a welcome touch.

Menu and wines showcased strong fundamentals. In particular, the Hokkaido scallop (with sake pairing), kinemedai and striploin exceeded our expectations. The two Burgundy wines selections lived up to expectations.

üüß My husband and I had dinner here tonight ( 29th May 2025 Thurs) at One-Ninety Restaurant at about 8.30 pm and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

üü© Decor & Ambience = ‚óè This high-end restaurant features an elegant and refined setting, with a warm and contemporary design that complements the luxury of the Four Seasons hotel. ‚ñ™Ô∏éThe ambience was calm and inviting, making it a great spot for a relaxed evening meal.

üîµ Food
*************
‚óè We ordered the local Hokkien Mee (SGD34), which the floor manager, Mei Yin, kindly spilt into two bowls for us.

‚óè This premium Hokkien Mee was very well-executed‚Äîflavourful, umami-rich, and satisfying. It struck a good balance between traditional taste and a beautiful presentation. The Hokkien Mee was chockful of ingredients like large Japanese scallops, big prawns, squid and scrambled eggs. ‚úîÔ∏è I asked for no pork slices.

‚óè  I also had an Iced Caf√© Latte (SGD13+), which was well-crafted. I requested for only one espresso shot and more milk, and the coffee brewed was smooth, creamy, and well-balanced.
_______________________________________________

üü® The service was polite, attentive, and accommodating throughout. Staff were courteous and efficient, ensuring our needs were met without being intrusive. ‚úîÔ∏è My request for adjustments to the coffee was handled perfectly.

ü©∑ Shoutout to Mei Yin, the floor manager, and a Thai service staff.‚ñ™Ô∏é  Ms Mei Yin was friendly and pleasant to us right from the start when we stepped into the restaurant. She was authentic, kind, very pleasant, and had an affable disposition. It is staff like Mei Yin who makes dining there at Four Seasons hotel a lovely experience.

üü° Overall, I must say this is a delightful dining experience in a stylish setting, with great service and high-quality food.

One-Ninety Restaurant,Sihan Goi,"One of the best buffet quality I've had in a long time. Had the semi buffet on valentines day with my wife and this is basically a salad bar buffet for $58/pax, and you can add on an entree for an extra $10. They also had wines for $14/glass, but this was only limited to a specific red and white wine. The buffet spread isn't very wide, but the quality was fantastic. Almost everything was a hit. Other tab the cold cuts and salads, there was also basis breads, a cheese station, and desserts. I especially enjoyed the soup of the day, which was a corn and crab soup - something I would not order normally and was actually disappointed in hearing about, but when it came and I tried it, I changed my mind immediately - it was that good. One Ninety, if you're reading this, you need to put this soup in your regular menu rather than have it as soup if the day.

For the entrees, I had the salmon and my wife had the duck leg, and both were very solid. The duck leg came with a sauce that tastes like Peking duck sauce, very creative and the meat was fall if the bone. The salmon came with an unknown sauce that looks a bit like pesto or chimichuri,but want very tasty. Nevertheless the salmon was fresh and succulent and cooked perfectly.

Dessert selection wasn't very wide either, but several of them were good. The $14 wines however didn't tickle our fancy, so we got the regular wines, which was very good. Comes with coffee or tea at the end too. I had a caf√© latte while my wife had a decaf caf√© latte. Both were unexpectedly good for a hotel buffet. In fact better than many cafes. Total came up to about $250 for 2 pax.

Service was excellent - professional, polite, earnest, but not overbearing. Pretty much the gold standard. Even the junior waiters seemed properly trained.

One-Ninety Restaurant,HelpMeMrYang,"Went for the lunchtime semi-buffet. One main course gets you free flow salad and desserts.

I had the laksa seabass as the main. The fish was the star, and was cooked perfectly, skin still crispy when served. The laksa was thick and fragrant. Would return just for the fish alone.

The duck confit is also pictured. Well done, but some people would consider the portion size of the duck small.

A warning that the salad and dessert selection was very limited... BUT... whatever they served was absolutely fantastic.

Very high quality and well-prepared. We went for seconds of many items (and even fourths, for the cherry tart). Seriously full marks.

In fact, I think this is the first time I've been to a buffet where all items are of quality.

Most hotel buffets in Singapore thrive on quantity, with above average quality so this time, it was refreshing to have something of such excellence!

Spouse favourite was the cherry tart, the crust was buttery and absolutely cracking. The Milo dinosaur cream puff was so creamy and so good. So good in fact, that we could only allow ourselves one, for health reasons. The pastry chef is pretty famous, and I can see why!

For people who love salads, the vegetables served were very fresh and very good quality. The vine tomatoes tasted practically like mandarin oranges! I need to know their source haha

Many unique plants also featured in the salad buffet, it was a colorful, healthy, and tasty feast. I would return for the salad selection.

The service was excellent. Each time we walked to the buffet table, our dishes and cutlery would be replaced, by invisible hands. It was truly service that did not intrude.

The whole restaurant was also very quiet, a welcome respite from normally bustling buffets. Very suitable for a romantic occasion.

Damage was about $130 for two pax, all taxes included. At this price, I don't feel I ever want to return to normal big-spread buffets that have average food.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/One-Ninety+Restaurant/@1.2893094,103.7916806,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da199e9f9c7995:0x7ca1b7d79bd6d2f0!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1936dd010223:0x9202f72c2b31f673!8m2!3d1.3052848!4d103.8287235!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSU2RVdEVZMFpSRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECBgQMw!16s%2Fg%2F11gfnhvnkx"

Ristorante Takada : Japanese Italian restaurant : Pasta Pizza Wine (Alexandra),Michelle Kam,"What a gem of a find in the most unlikely place, below a condominium block, right at the edge of Alexandra!

Been back twice since, the first time we went for dinner and tried the more luxe items and the second time, we went back for lunch and had the basic set lunch - both, were amazingly delicious!

My favourites include the mushroom soup, corn foam appetiser, the Spanish pork, the carbonara, the burnt cheesecake with sorbet and the Mont Blanc! That‚Äôs basically almost everything that I‚Äôve tried but it‚Äôs thaaaattt good.

Pura Brasa Singapore,Jia T,"1. Charcoal Seafood Paella by Josper
This dish, often the centrepiece of a Spanish table, unfortunately didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. The grains of rice were noticeably flat‚Äîboth in texture and shape‚Äîlacking the nutty bite and layered flavour profile that typically come from a well-rendered paella. At one point, I wondered if the presentation took inspiration from Korean-style scorched rice (""nurungji""), given the burnt bottom and compactness of the grains. A touch more depth from seafood stock and attention to the rice's integrity could elevate this dish significantly.

2. Grilled Octopus Leg with Potato Truffle Pur√©e
This dish showed more promise. The octopus had a pleasant char, and though slightly firmer than ideal, it was nicely offset by the silky, well-infused truffle potato pur√©e. The smokiness in the cream subtly lifted the overall flavour profile to meet expectations.

3. Prawn Casserole Saut√©ed with Garlic Peppers and Olive Oil
A delightful surprise. The prawns were fresh and delicately cooked, soaking up the aromatic olive oil and garlic. What truly elevated this dish was the accompanying bread‚Äîcrisp on the outside, fluffy inside, and perfect for mopping up every last drop of the sauce. Ironically, the bread proved more memorable than the paella rice, which speaks to the quality of ingredients when simplicity is done right.

4. Padron Peppers
A familiar Spanish snack, the version here was decent‚Äîlightly blistered and seasoned‚Äîbut ultimately lacked the punch that makes Padron peppers addictive. In comparison, the rendition served at FOC delivers bolder flavour and a better texture.

5. Strawberry and Smoked Salmon Salad -
6. The Josper Spare Pork Ribs

While not all dishes reached their full potential, the overall service and effort in presentation are commendable. The prawn casserole and Padron peppers hint at the kitchen‚Äôs capabilities when ingredients and preparation align. I left with warm memories thanks to the service. Perhaps with the chef's guidance or a tasting menu next round, Pura Brasa could truly showcase the best of its Spanish repertoire.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pura+Brasa+Singapore/@1.2766695,103.8102264,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da19131823ca01:0xac793dffcd0ff380!8m2!3d1.2766695!4d103.8462753!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESc3BhbmlzaF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5LWjNVdGRtNTNSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECBEQRg!16s%2Fg%2F11g8lqplxb"
Pura Brasa Singapore,Z Ong,"Nachos were pretty good even thou were store bought. The grilled octopus was nicely charred, soft and balanced out with citrus. The only thing was the portion was kinda small. Carbonara pork pizza was heavy on the pork flavours but the pizza rim was quite thick, very filling. Secreto pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked, love the slightly pinkish doneness where pork should be cooked to. Seafood paella was quite al dente, edible but should have cooked a little more.

Things to note:
- Singaporeans should sign up for Sentosa Islander and get discounted tickets
- There is a minimum height and age requirement which makes sense because some of the obstacles are spaced quite far apart.
- Only life jackets are provided (somehow I thought there may be towels)

We ordered 2 8-course set and 1 Christmas set. Do note that you won‚Äôt be able to change any dish in the Christmas course meal. Each course was served super fast, we didn‚Äôt even have time to finish before the next one was served, so it got to a point where the table was filled with appetisers, soup and mains. Some servers would practically dump the plate on our table loudly and walk away like we owe them?

Moving on to the taste, the fruit rojak, sesame tofu, and unagi roll with tofu were not bad. Everything else tasted pretty average. Some of my friends found it weird that the appetisers and soup are sweet. We were looking forward to the desserts since they looked really pretty from the photos, but they tasted like store bought frozen 711 products. They didn‚Äôt even properly defrost them before serving.

The restaurant closes at 3.30, and they really chased all of us out on the dot. As such, we were scrambling to finish our food. Have been to other restaurants that closes in the afternoon before, and they all allowed guests to stay on in the restaurant, just that there would be no ordering/serving/billing after the stipulated closing time.

Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant,Arnold K H Tan,"Decided to go with the staff recommendation of the Hitsu set. Grilled unagi had a nice crisp on the exterior and was lightly flavoured.

As per the staff recommendation,  first tried the unagi with rice alone, and then with the broth... and then with the broth and condiments added. Each has its own flavour notes, and I enjoyed the unagi + broth + condiment pairing (scallion, seaweed flakes and a touch of fresh wasabi)

Fresh grated wasabi was an interesting condiment to pair with the grilled unagi.

Meta Restaurant,Pratyush Rastogi,"Meta gives you a full-mounted experience of modern Korean cuisine, with an expert blend of textures and subtle flavors. They use high-quality ingredients (scallop, uni, abalone, octopus, wagyu) to bring you great flavours and balanced dishes. I was worried that the fancy ingredients would be a crutch but I submitted to the experience and was impressed by how well integrated the dishes were. Courses to me that showed great control and flavour were - tart, toast, jeju abalone, ok-dom, and sweet potato dessert). Also, unlike some 2-3 Michelin star restaurants that leave you feeling a bit hungry (which is a shame considering the cost), Meta's menu is for heavyweights and I had to tap out by the petit fours. I was rolling out of the restaurant at the end of the night.

The front-of house team is highly professional. I never had to wait more than a few seconds to get service and they paced the meal really well. Knowing you're well looked after allowed me to drop my guard and focus on the food. I was noticed how they worked in pairs to ensure to sweep away all diners plates at the same time. My only mild feedback is that the seats left me with a slight back crank so could do with a bit more padding.

Overall, I would highly recommend going for the food and experience.

Meta Restaurant,Theresa Wan,"This was a restaurant that I‚Äôve been wanting to try when they were a michelin star and eventually took the plunge after they were awarded two stars. Unfortunately, the experience was similar to what other reviews had described.
1. Squeaking in at one Michelin rather than two.
2. Chef played it too safe, nothing mind blowing, just familiar and simple flavour profile.

Other pet peeves included
1. Not having a menu on their website. While the menu may change daily depending on the quality and supply of ingredients, the overall dish still remain the same with the exception of one or two being entirely different. Include a disclaimer on the menu that the chef reserves the right to amend the menu. Having a menu with general indication on what‚Äôs going to be served does help customers understand what they are in for.
2. Not checking in with customers on the food. I left the tail of the prawn on the plate because it was not properly deveined with the black bits visible. I left the scales of the fish because it was just too gross to eat fried scales (though I know it was an intentional attempt by the chef to create texture in the food). No one came and ask how the food was.

Despite the above, I have to commend the restaurant for making amendments to the menu to align with my preferences and for offering additional ‚Äòsurprise courses‚Äô.

Food wise - the scallop tart and sweet potato rum dessert were well executed and flavourful. They should be kept on the menu.

The bananan cream puff was bad, tasted like overripe bananas. Geotgam was terrible, tasted like stale biscuits. The rest of the dishes were just normal, tasted them before in other restaurants, nothing fancy won‚Äôt come back for them.

Meta Restaurant,Marc Woo,"Not a bad attempt to fusionize the dishes from different parts of KR. Tasty yes, some expensive products perhaps to justify the cost, but there was no explosive standout that warrants the price. No narrative or journey. And the presentation slightly above average. I agree with other reviews that they were heavy handed with the sodium. My wife and I were thirsty a few hours after the meal! :(

I tend to indulge in a bottle of wine at these posh establishments even knowing the margins they make. But Meta jacked up the numericals in the wine list that we agreed to work our liver after the meal. We had their free water though ;)

Meta Restaurant,Anton 999,"We‚Äôd been wanting to come here for a while and decided to book during the festive period. What an outstanding meal. The food is a modern take on Korean and Japanese fusion. The tastes, the textures, the presentation ‚Äî everything just works. There is tremendous attention to detail in the preparation and the ingredients chosen are of the highest quality. Perhaps my only gripe would be that the quantity of food could be a little better. Some of the portions were just too small. The wine pairings were interesting and well executed. You get a selection of unusual wines, as well as sake, that excite the palette and pair wonderfully with the dishes. You also don‚Äôt leave feeling like you had too much to drink. It‚Äôs balanced and satisfying. The service was well-timed and unobtrusive with an attention to detail that‚Äôs hard to find. If Meta is on your list, definitely do book ahead. They will call you to confirm and also ask about any dietary issues so that the menu can be adjusted accordingly, if needed. Unless you have particular issues, I‚Äôd say just go with flow and see what they serve you. Perhaps the only caveat I would give is that it‚Äôs not cheap.

UNA at The Alkaff Mansion,Desmond Tan,"Great place for a date with nice ambience and friendly staff.

But food wise some hits and misses. Salpicon and lobster bisque was good and value for money. Gambas decent but nothing extraordinary. Scallops definitely over priced and would not recommend. Used to be 3 pieces in the past but perhaps because now they added some caviar. Can just order Salpicon which itself contains 1 scallop already (along with other seafood).

Thus overall I would recommend Una for the venue and setting.

UNA at The Alkaff Mansion,Andrew Lim,"Everything from the food, to the service and the atmosphere was top notch. We were hosted by Seraj and Brandon for the night and they were ever so prompt and attentive throughout our entire dinner. We had the Coca De Higos Y Foie Con Vermouth and the Vieras A La Plancha Con Sobrasada Iberica as starters, the Paella De Chorizo Y Habitas to share and Churrors el Classico for dessert.

Both starters were cooked to perfection and we especially liked the chorizo topped scallops which had a good balance of saltiness. The small sized paella was perfect for the two of us and the chorizo used was not too salty and had a perfectly minced texture.

When it came to ordering our dessert, we were throughly impressed by Brandon‚Äôs psychic abilities. He brought out the churros and an anniversary cake almost immediately after placing our order, almost as if he knew we were ordering the churros.

5 Senses Bistro The Star Vista,Chin Chris,"1) The restaurant is cozy and comfortable, making it suitable for gatherings, though the space is not very large, so reservations are recommended.
Pleasant dining environment, making it a solid choice for casual meals or small group gatherings.
2) Affordable prices, casual atmosphere, and good variety of Western and fusion dishes.
Value-for-money set lunches and the reasonable pricing for mains, which typically range from under $20 for pastas and risottos to the mid-$20s for meat dishes.
3) Signature items like the bacon-wrapped chicken breast, duck confit, and Australian braised lamb shank are tender, flavourful, and well-executed.
The crab cake comes with generous crabmeat, and desserts such as the apple crumble and chocolate lava cake are recommended for their taste and presentation.
The seafood pasta, served in a crab-shaped container and packed with prawns, crab meat, mussels, and clams, is also a standout for its rich, bisque-like sauce.

We really liked the scallops, pork chop and of course the beef! Total bill came up to about $370 for three pax.

Cinder Steakhouse at Wheeler's Estate,Lionel Tan,We came early for dinner. Best to book as this place is popular. We had the Ceaser Salad and ox tail ragout. The ragout is recommended and done very well. We shared the Surf and Turf and would also recommend it. The beef was well prepared and tender. It is also great that they offer tap water for free and kept refilling! Many restaurants now do not offer this and it turns customers off. So very glad that this restaurant is far sighted.

Cinder Steakhouse at Wheeler's Estate,Jeff Sim,"We were there 2 weeks ago on 5th Nov to celebrate my wife's birthday
The waitress Ling was very friendly, professional & attentive in the way she served us.
Karma was very pleasant and experience in his knowledge of wine though the first bottle he recommended to us was a bit acidic but he's allows us to reject it & recommended another bottle to us without any unfriendly body languages or facial expressions.

The steaks were tender and tasty.  Would love to come back again.

Ramd was very pleasant and welcoming.  He greeted us and talked to us in a very welcoming way.

Overall,  great experience but honestly,  it would be ideal if the price can be a little cheaper taking into consideration the service tax + the GST, the amount we are paid for that is already for another steak.

Royal Palm @ Orchid Country Club Restaurant,FIVE-A-DAY,"We had dinner buffet at the restaurant with my family.  It is a halal restaurant and is very big.  It is mostly indoor seating with some tables al fresco but still sheltered, so no worries about inclement weather even if seated outside.

The variety of dishes served was amazing.  The seafood dishes were fresh and I loved the flavours. Among the seafood dishes, there were prawns (of good size), crabs, fish, mussels, clams etc.  If you are looking for more meat, there‚Äôs chicken cooked in a few styles, rendang beef, satay, chicken and mutton with a delicious satay sauce to go with.  There is also a salad corner for you to assemble your little simple salad.  I love the dessert corner, it offers a good variety of western and local desserts to choose from.  There were kueh kuehs, cakes, bread/mango puddings, pulut hitam, ice cream, churros etc all not overly sweet, which is great as we are more health conscious these days.

The food was continually replenished in a timely manner though there was a huge dinner crowd, there wasn‚Äôt anything that completely ran out that I have to give it a miss. Satay was very popular among the diners and it ran out fast but eventually we also got to try it and there were sufficient for everyone.

Though there were many diners, everyone queued in an orderly manner at the buffet line.

The wait staff is also very polite, friendly and efficient and I really do appreciate the good service.

There was also live music too on the night that I was there.

Overall it was a lovely dining experience and our family enjoyed the company and the amazing variety of food (everyone in the group could find something they like) üòç

Parking is also easy as there are many parking lots (unless there are special functions taking place).

I love the buffet (so did my family) and I would come back again for family gatherings in future.

Update:

Went back again on a Saturday night for the buffet due to the favourable experience the last time on a weekday.  The restaurant was very crowded and I think it was full house.  However, this time round, the experience wasn‚Äôt as great, so I have moderated the rating based on both visits.

The queue for drinks was very very long and people were filling a few cups each and queueing for their relatives and friends, such that when I thought I was just behind a few more people, they were suddenly joined by a whole group of others and each one filling a few cups - very irritating. The drinks queue actually reached the door leading to the outdoor satay station, until they had to designate a staff to do the filling of drinks for the diners.  As we were seated near to the drinks machine, there was so much spillage on the floor that we were practically stepping on sticky liquid every time we left the table to get more food.  The queue for food was super long too and sometimes one of the dishes run out but we still have to move along the buffet line in order not to hold back the rest of the diners, but when the dish was replenished later and we only wanted to get hold of some of that dish, we will need to re-queue because some of the diners actually don‚Äôt allow us to go straight to the dish that we missed.  Satay station had no plates or bowls, and people were just grabbing bunches of satay and trying to put satay sauce on them initially, until someone feedback to the staff, only then were some bowls and dishes placed there.  Very different experience since the first time we were here.

The so-called ‚Äúinternational buffet‚Äù was very underwhelming‚Äîlimited food selection that didn‚Äôt live up to its name. Yet, the price was $1xx++ per pax, the same as premium buffets in town.

Service was also a letdown‚Äîespecially the Indian lady at the reception, who was cold and unfriendly.

Royal Palm @ Orchid Country Club Restaurant,defunct32,"First time dining here at the Royal Palms @ OCC and the experience was very pleasant. The location is convenient to get to with free shuttle service from Yishun MRT to the Royal Palms and vice-versa (every 15 minutes, schedule can be found at the Royal Palms official website).

There is an on-going promotion (went on the 10th of Sept 2022, Sat) for 1-for-1 so we gathered our loved ones for a wonderful dinner after work!

I really like the ambient; spacious (there's room to walk around) and well-lit, the dishes are placed neatly like any other buffet setting. The service staff were all friendly and approachable. They will walk around and assist to clear away your plates so you can go ahead and grab yourself some more morsels or hefty portion of what's available on the menu.

For that particular evening I helped myself to a generous plate of White Rice, Beef Rendang, Teriyaki Chicken Cutlet and Mixed Baby Kailan. Beef Rendang was tender and it's Rendang you can never go wrong it was so-good! Teriyaki Chicken Cutlet was on the slightly sweet and savoury side really complement with the crunchy Mixed Baby Kailan veggie dish (there's baby corn, mushrooms, but prominently Kailan). This was definitely filling.

Next round I grabbed two Sweet Potatoes, BBQ Wings (I think?), two Mantous, three Peppery Sausages and Kambing Golek (Skewered Lamb, I think) douses generously in Black Pepper Sauce Chicken Tikka and Flatbread, let's just say they were wiped cleaned despite the first plate of rice and side dishes made me kind of full.

I also had traditional Malay kuehs but I am bad at Malay kueh names so... there's kueh lapis like rainbow color, brown chewy kueh in shave coconut? There are cakes, pastries, churros and Satays (mutton and chicken) as well.

Fruits, salad, ice-creams you name it you'll definitely be spoiled for choice.

Dinner was also accompanied by acoustic performances a mix of Malay and English songs though am not sure if the singer is a staff, on contract or a dinner guest? But on that night it was a very talented Malay lady who sang. At the end of the evening the staff came over and asked how was our dinner and we had a small wonderful chat, color me impressed and these small gestures really makes me want to visit another time.

Tried their Hokkaido Oysters. Half dozen for $10, super worth it. The fresh one is fleshy and fresh. The baked cheese one is juicy with a generous layer of savoury melted cheese and mayonnaise.

The pork rack 350g is super huge, probably can share with someone. The meat is super soft and tender, the peppercorn cream sauce is so fragrant and enhanced the flavours of the meat. Love the fries that taste good even when cold.

The sirloin steak is good too. The pepper taste is on the stronger side with a spicy kick.

Crimson Restaurant,Dino Lapiz,"Dining at Crimson within Bird Paradise was truly a highlight of our visit. From the moment we stepped in, we felt a sense of warmth and elegance that set the stage for a memorable meal.

It's clear that Crimson's team puts immense care into creating an exceptional experience. The service was simply impeccable, with every interaction feeling genuine and attentive. In particular, Jessica's service stood out. She was incredibly helpful and made sure we felt completely at ease, adding a personal touch that elevated our dining experience.

As for the food, each dish was a delightful exploration of flavors. We started with the truffle fries, which were perfectly crisp and wonderfully aromatic ‚Äì a truly satisfying beginning. The lamb shank was a masterpiece; the meat was so tender it practically melted in our mouths, a testament to the chef's skill. The King Prawn Aglio Olio pasta was another hit, with perfectly cooked prawns and a lovely balance of garlic and olive oil. The King Prawn Laksa was a revelation, bursting with authentic, rich flavors that left us wanting more.

For dessert, the red wine poached pear was a sweet and sophisticated finish, a beautiful blend of texture and taste. And to accompany our meal, the lemon mint tea was refreshingly light, just the right amount of mint and lemon without being overly sweet ‚Äì a perfect palate cleanser.

Crimson Restaurant,Travis Lee,"Tucked inside a tourist spot, Crimson Restaurant defies expectations with great food, stunning views, and excellent service.

We had low expectation for the food, given that crimson restaurant is nested within a tourist attraction. However, we were surprised, the quality exceeded what we had anticipated, and the food turned out to be quite good.

Their window seats offer the best view in the entire bird paradise, creating a unique dining experience with a bird watching backdrop. The staff were very friendly and welcoming even during a busy weekend lunch service. Despite being informed that the restaurant was packed and food will take about 45mins to prepare, our order was served in just 15mins. Our kid enjoy the kids meal that came with a cup of juice and an ice cream.

As expected for a restaurant within a tourist spot, the prices are on the higher side. However, posb credit cards may enjoy a 10% discount, while those with cooperate passes can get a 20% discount to offset gst and service charge.

The manager printed a receipt from the NETS machine, and i wanted to use it for proof that we had paid but he said it is confidential and could not give us. Then, he was very rude about this whole experience. He told us off as if it was our fault when in fact it was the machine‚Äôs fault. So, we had to pay another $58 to finally eat. Imagine spending $110 + at Texas Chicken. I don‚Äôt know if this is a scam tactic by your staff. I have also contacted the bank, and they said that it was not possible for the cashier to not receive any information backend as payment was already deducted. I am now discussing with NETS.

Come here at your own risk if you want to lose money and get told off by the rude manager when it‚Äôs not even your fault in the first place. To Texas Chicken, please feel free to check the CCTV or any records as proof that we‚Äôve paid. As I am not in the wrong, I am not afraid.

Bottle tree cafe restaurant by sembawang eating house seafood restaurant,Boon J,"TLDR: AVOID holiday or when there is a crowd if possible as the system to collect the food is FLAWED.

After ordering 4 mains from the self ordering kiosk, my family sat down and waited. The system calling the order was found to be based NOT in order of Q number. Worse, one staff has to key in the Q number based on whichever dish is cooked and handed to him.

Something was amiss after 30 mins and we found our Q number not being called while Q number after ours were called.

It was observed a lot of people waiting at the counter and I noticed dishes which we ordered were taken away.

Captain's Table,Norman Ng,"Absolutely outstanding experience at The Captain‚Äôs Table! Every dish was a delight, and the service was top-notch.

We started with the Fish Maw Soup‚Äîrich, flavorful, and comforting. The Steamed Fish was perfectly cooked, fresh and tender, with a light, fragrant sauce. The Roast Chicken was juicy with crispy skin and a hint of spice‚Äîso satisfying!

The Prawns and Scallops were incredibly fresh and cooked just right, while the Mushrooms with Sea Cucumber brought a luxurious, umami-rich depth to the meal.

To end on a sweet note, the Mango Puree with Pomelo and Sago was refreshing and not overly sweet‚Äîabsolutely perfect.

What really stood out was the attentive and professional service. The staff were friendly, prompt, and thoughtful throughout the entire evening. Every detail was taken care of.

Captain's Table,novamber15,"disclaimer: they‚Äôre a little understaffed, so service and food may be slower for this place. I don‚Äôt mind as I like to take my time with food!

Wonderful place to have dinner at - the sunset views are stunning at the correct hour.

Fish maw soup: Very balanced. Just the right saltiness and texture. Have a little sip first before adding in (just a little bit of!) vinegar and pepper to taste the difference.

Stir fried scallops with asparagus in truffle: interestingly good! In many dishes I‚Äôve had, the truffle taste is stronger (and after a while it gets overpowering), but in this dish it was just a hint - a really delicate highlight to compliment the dish as a whole. Asparagus texture was just right - easy to chew but not too crunchy.

Stir fried kurobuta (black pork) in black pepper sauce: very tender!

Peking duck: must order in advance! Make a reservation and order in advance due to the preparation the kitchen must make prior to the meal. I really love the ‚Äúpastry‚Äù they use to wrap the skin for the meal, it‚Äôs thin and fragrant. They‚Äôll serve it half with cucumber and half with spring onion. For the second round, you can choose to have it one out of several ways (if I remember correctly : fried rice, stir fried with e-mian, salt and pepper stir fried, ginger/garlic and onion stir fry, or just chopped up and served).

Mango and pomelo was nice and fragrant, not too thick but also not too watery.

Deep fried Red bean pancake: MUST ORDER. Can‚Äôt stress this enough; this was actually so good. Exterior was wonderfully crispy without being too oily, and the red bean paste in the middle was fragrant and delicious. Got a ‚Äúnot too sweet‚Äù of approval from family members! (ps: you should probably order this dessert slightly ahead of time, not at the end of the meal but maybe before your second last or last dish arrives since it takes time to prepare by hand.)

Star of the whole meal was service staff Simon, who also did the table side Peking duck serving. Very charismatic and charming. Will definitely come back again!

Total was around 300+ for 5 people.

I am so glad my family enjoyed all the food so much as it were everybody 1st  despite some delayed at the last minute where more diners started to walk-in. The manager offers his apologise & fill our 2 tables with complimentary food which we really appreciated.
I must said:
the steam prawn is exceptionally fresh & nice, the fried seabass is so flavorful, chicken is so yummy & juicy, tofu is crisp & soft, fishmaw is thick with ingredients,
a ""WOW"" to the pancake,
yam paste is thick with gingko nuts, ribs is tender & crisp.
Peking duck come with 2 combi flavour that need to order in advance.
I am not a noodle person but the remaining duckmeat fried with noodle caught me by surprise. Light & refreshing.
As most member of the family are taught to cook when we were young we find all the food are flavourful, not salty nor sweet. We had a bountiful stomach after having our meal. Everybody said affordable & worth.
Menu & price can be located in the website.

Seroja,Elaine Neo (Ê¢ÅÈõÅÂ©∑),"I‚Äôll admit I was skeptical at first. As a Malaysian, I‚Äôve seen too many ‚Äúelevated‚Äù takes on our food that end up stripping it of soul, layering it with truffle or uni, and calling it fine dining.

But Seroja surprised me. Every ingredient was sourced from Malaysia. Every dish honoured the original flavours I grew up with, and a lot more: bold, earthy, layered while still elevating them in a way that felt opened up your tastebud in a surprisingly good way. Every single dish on the tasting menu was on point (and I‚Äôm also biased with the nostalgic points here).

Seroja,Muzainy Shahiefisally,"Was quite excited to visit Seroja after all the hype surrounding its opening. Eventually made my way there to celebrate my birthday with family and was left rather disappointed. The food was good. But it wasn‚Äôt great. It lacked the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that meals of this ilk ought to evoke. The canap√©s were creative enough, especially the duck with sambal hijau. The tuna with ginger kerabu for the first course was good, but nothing special and set the tone for the rest of the meal. The second course was fish, the presentation of which was somewhat lacking as it consisted of all-beige tones and lacked colour. The dish, again, tasted good with the fish being well-cooked and the sauce adding a bit of spice. The third course was a scallop in sort of laksa sauce. The best dish out of a rather middling menu. Then came the main course. The moment it was laid out before me, I recognised the style of plating. Meta does (or did, not too sure as I haven‚Äôt visited since they moved) the exact same plating for their main of Korean bbq. I opted for beef short ribs over the lamb. Short ribs were very well cooked. But again, the fact that the plating seemed to be copied and all the elements of the dish could be found down the road at Arab Street for far cheaper left me sorely disappointed. When you want to showcase a cuisine in a fine-dining format, you need to elevate the ingredients and the traditional dishes. This elevation should not only involve a change from cheaper beef to more expensive alternatives. Rather, it needs to be demonstrated in the chef‚Äôs level of finesse. Desserts and palate cleansers were ok. Their bahulu was completely average. Once again, the chef seems to have confused elevation with using premium ingredients. A home-cook can opt to use Wagyu instead of regular beef to make a burger patty. That alone, however, does not elevate the burger that the cook is making.

VERDICT:
Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Clearly the people singing praises of this restaurant have not gone down the road to eat malay food or have never tasted it. Where the Michelin guide is concerned, it‚Äôs understandable that they‚Äôd be so easily enamoured as they‚Äôre French and haven‚Äôt gone down to Geylang to eat proper malay cuisine. Priced at $218 for lunch, you‚Äôd be better off dining at other, more creative, Michelin-starred establishments like Sommer or Poise or even Nouri which has started it‚Äôs lunch specials at $68++.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seroja/@1.2996321,103.8223254,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1769b163bd07:0x514706a6e4f23eef!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da192a2e65f5fb:0x42aacaf487964753!8m2!3d1.2996321!4d103.8583743!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEUbWFsYXlzaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUTVhMDFpZDFsM0VBRaoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAEEw!16s%2Fg%2F11t4dhf54t"

2. *Shimeji Fries*: The brown sauce adds a unique twist.
3. *Seabass Kabayaki* w Bread: Although enjoyable, I thought the seabass spread portion could be reduced for better balance. Additionally, the bread could be cut into bite-sized pieces, as the large chunks were slightly difficult to bite through.

Service was excellent and staff was prompt to refill the complimentary warm/chill plain water.

Service was great, the staff took the time to explain the dishes and how to eat them, and they were attentive enough throughout the meal.

Ristorante Luka - Tanjong Pagar,Daphne Yeo,"Amazing pizzas just the way pizzas should be. Crusty chewy edges, thin base, generous toppings. We had the Diavola and Prosciutto Rucola Burrata pizzas and I preferred the latter. They use the San Daniele Ham here instead of Parma, which I thought was a good choice. The ham was still thin but softer without the chewy, 'plastic-ky' texture of Parma.

We also had the Calamari, a Carbonara and a seasonal Granchio Risotto to share.

The Calamari was on point, nothing wow but faultless too. I always found Carbonara a good choice for sharing as a normal portion is often too heavy (or jelak as we locals say) for one, leaving no space to try other stuff. So being able to share with 4 others and having just 2 mouthfuls is just nice. Though I wished the bacon was a bit more seared/burnt.

The risotto was an interesting burst of flavours that isn't traditional of a risotto but delish.

They don't serve table water here so it's still or sparkling at $2.50 each but it comes free flow.

Not sure if I'll return for the pasta but am certain it'll be worth returning for the pizzas at least.

The scallop linguine was the highlight for me, the minimal quality ingredients created a very well balanced dish that came together very nicely.

The margherita pizza had a very chewy interior with a crispy but not too hard crust that I enjoyed.

The tiramisu was creamy but had a coffee taste that did not overshadow the other elements of the dessert as well.

The service was splendid as they suggested for the pizza to be served the last which allowed us to really enjoy all the dishes hot and fresh.

d.o.c Italian Restaurant,GG K,"One of the more authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore, d.o.c serves up quality food, worth the price paid even though its on the high side.

We tried the Diavola Pizza, Gorgonzola e Salsiccia Pizza, Risotto al Polpo Nero, and a Tiramisu for dessert. They start you off with a bread basket, which, unlike the typical Italian restaurant, is a soft kind of bread but nonetheless tastes very fragrant. The pizza was good, not the best I've had but well above average. The pizza crust had a good savoury taste to it, though I felt like it lacked the flavour of a long fermented dough. I personally preferred the Diavola to the Gorgonzola, as it was more flavourful. I really liked their risotto, this was very authentic. The octopus was cooked to perfection and had that delicious sea saltiness to it. The rice also wasn't overcooked, and still had a firm bite to it. As for the tiramisu, it was also very good, not too sweet and moist enough for the coffee taste to shine through.

However, we were all quite parched after the meal, so we had to drink a lot of water afterwards but they serve tap water free of charge here, so no matter.

Service here is average, it can get a bit confusing for customers though, as the waiters don't wear uniforms. The atmosphere is good for meetups, but they could improve on the air conditioning, as the place was quite hot.

Fleur De Sel Le Restaurant,pianized,"We came on a weekend night and had a great time there. Five stars food and five stars service. The interior is minimalistic where tables are arranged around an open concept kitchen counter, there is a private room that sits 8-10 pax at the back. Expect nothing less for food presentation, dishes were colorful like how French cuisine is supposed to be. Great attention to details e.g. micro slices on our king oyster mushroom pieces, symmetry of the ensembles, etc. Of all the dishes from our Degustation set, we enjoyed the starter, Le Crabe, the most as the dish was very light and refreshing. Lobster bisque was outstanding and scallop carpacio melted in our mouths. At the end of the main courses prior to desserts, cheeses were served.

Fleur De Sel Le Restaurant,Janice Lee,"When I reserved a table at Fleur De Sel, I was only thinking of just enjoying some nice French food at a modern setting, and oh boy, this restaurant brings so much more onto the table. I'm totally impressed since I enjoy the complete set of classic French hospitality here: complimentary Bread with French butter, the Canap√©s, the pouring of sauces over the dishes in front of the patrons (I miss this nice little gesture so much, my last experiences with this were at Odette and French restaurants of such caliber many years ago), the French palate cleanser and the Petit Fours.

Best of all, I get to enjoyed these without costing an arm or a leg. And yes, lots of videos ensured to capture the pouring of sauces. Feel free to request the friendly and patient staff to hold on for a while while getting the video mode ready. By the way, the service here is exceptional. It really takes me to the days of dining at classic French restaurants that achieve perfection in service.

The setting of the restaurant is contemporary and classy, with the colour white as main theme. I can really feel that I'm in a fancy French restaurant here (the French songs playing in the background helps with that), but without the dining-is-serious-business vibe due to the modern feel of the place. So I feel very ease here actually and loving it lol

The real show begins when Le Crabe is served. The rich-in-flavours ingredients really work their magic here. Briny fresh crab, buttery n grassy avocado and refreshingly, mildly sweet balsamic sorbet work so well together. I love this creamy treat.

The awesome dining journey continues with La Saint-Jacques. The seared succulent plump Hokkaido scallop has this amazing pan seared surface that is slightly crispy and carries an iota of smokiness, Butternut squash pur√©e adds the earthy sweetness while Parma ham introduces bits of excitement into the taste.

Lychee granita is one of the best palate cleansers I have. I love the sweet floral taste of lychee and the minuscule bites of lychee gives a nice variation in texture.

Le Baba is oh-so-good. In fact, I heard the patrons at a neighbouring table swooning over this.

The service staff will slice the baba cake in half in front of the patrons. And the cake actually jiggle a bit when the knife slice through it: a testimony to how fluffy it is. And a look at the interior proves it. Next comes the Bailey's. The staff will enquire on the preferred amount of Bailey's to be added prior to adding it in. Lastly, the generous amount of light and fresh creamy Vanilla cream is added onto the Baba. This hits the right spot in both taste and texture. The cream and the tart taste of passionfruit glaze juxtapose so well with the herbal bitterness of Bailey's.

This is a must-try here.

I'm really surprised by how intricate the dining experience here, and I feel so pampered when dining here. By the way, there is no dress code, so one can enjoy fine French food in a relaxing ambience and clothing. This is one of the places I will recommend to experience the full extent of French dining while not over-stressing the wallet.

Fleur De Sel Le Restaurant,Roger C,"Had a Saturday lunch, degustation menu. As a fine dining restaurant, the service can improve such as providing envelopes for facemasks, louder and clearer voice when explaining the dishes. Very good quality ingredients, but bland overall to me. Difficult to notice complexity in some of the dishes. White asparagus with Panchetta and Scallops with Leek were my favorite. Amuse bouche and the main (Le Boeuf) were my least favorite. The beef jus with the main was too salty, almost like soy sauce. Looking back at the menu on the website, I wonder why we got the white Asparagus instead of Foie gras üòÖ maybe I have overlooked the menu at the restaurant?
Wine pairing was superb though. Lifted experience well. Nicely selected wines.

Fleur De Sel Le Restaurant,Bud Travels The World,"Our favourite French restaurant in Singapore, Fleur De Sel, has refreshed their charming interior and Chef-owner Alexandre Lozachmeur has added new food and wine selections to their menu ‚ù§

Let's enjoy a degustation set meal with wine pairing in Fleur De Sel's newly renovated interior. We love the new decor in elegant cream and white palette, with lovely white orchids and palm trees that transport us to a charming tropical paradise as we indulge in the wonderful creations by Chef Alex:

üåü Amuse Bouche: We start off with a delightful bubbly Champagne Delamotte and an Amuse bouche of beef terrine with saffron mayo and pickled vegetable to whet our appetite for the wonderful food journey to come üòã

üåü La Truite: We love the beautifully presented fresh Tasmanian ocean trout sashimi with aromatic herbs tartare, tangy finger lime from Australia, avocado pur√©e, all topped with an elegant round lattice squid ink crisp. Each mouthful explodes with refreshing flavours and textures üòã

üåü Le Canard: The enchanting smell of truffle wafts up as we enjoy duck consomm√© infused with Lapsang souchong tea, mini foie gras raviolis, julienne Australian Manjimup black truffle and truffle toast. We pair this with a light sweet Mount Riley Marlborough Pinot Gris 2020, one of our favourite wines üòã

üåü La Saint-Jacques:¬† Special pressed dehydrated Kaviari caviar is grated over plump seared Hokkaido scallops, decorated with cauliflower pur√©e and chicken jus. Delicate in flavour with wonderful textures üòã

üåü¬†Le Boeuf: We love this 2-hour sous-vide and seared Toriyama Wagyu beef tenderloin A4, with Romanesco broccoli pur√©e, poached yellow and green zucchini and red wine sauce. We pair this with a mellow St Hallett Barossa Faith Shiraz 2019 that further elevates the delicious beef flavour üòã

üåü Selection of Cheeses: We enjoy a palette cleanser of cucumber and mint followed by a beautiful selection of cheeses from the cheese board. We pair this with a sweet digestif from Domaine Cauhap√© 2018 Ballet d'Octobre (Juran√ßon)

üåü Le Baba: Our must have dessert at Fleur de Sel! We love the rum soaked baba glazed in passionfruit juice topped with Tahitian vanilla whipped cream. A wonderful and classic dessert üòã

üåü Petit Fours: Look at how cute these Petit Fours look on the little bulldog serving plate! We get delightful canel√©, macarons, jellies and more. Such a lovely end to a wonderful meal üòã

Little Lazy Lizard,Andy Yxyz,"Arrived at a rather unassuming restaurant that also looked like a cozy pub for gathering, I was feeling a little regretful if we have picked the right place for a cozy dinner.

The waiter was courteous and patient to allow us pick our options. For starters, we ordered the Caesar salad with chicken breast, truffle fries and beef sliders. The truffle fries was crispy and hot. When paired with truffles, it was simply amazing. The beef slider was also delicious.

We also ordered the Margherita pizza which were decently appetizing as the cheese was generous and accentuates well with the tomatoes. The highlight has to be the squid ink seafood risotto. It was very balanced and refreshing with every bite and comes with three large fresh prawns cooked to perfection.

The duck confit was also delicious. Not the best, if you compare to the standards of France, but decently good. The pasta penne was also above average.

Overall, I was wrong to judge the restaurant by the outlook. The food was truly amazing and cost me about S$180 after using the ""Eatigo"" app which gave a 20% discount.

Atout,Ankori,"Upon arrival we proceed to select our preferred wine for lunch from a small but well-curated cellar featuring a mix of old and new world selections. The selection, while not extensive, was respectable and provided enough variety to suit different preferences.
While we were tempted to explore more of the menu, we focused on the cold and hot appetizers. The monkfish liver‚Äîoften called the ‚Äúfoie gras of the sea‚Äù was a standout, boasting a smooth, creamy texture that melted effortlessly on the palate. In contrast, the duck rillette, rich in fat, presented an entirely different yet equally indulgent experience, offering a deep, savory flavor that reset the senses after the monkfish liver.
Moving on to the hot starters, the escargots were baked in a fragrant garlic butter that was impossible to resist, especially when paired with bread to soak up every last drop of the flavorful sauce. The chorizo sausages were another highlight, boasting a coarse texture and a well-balanced spice profile. Unlike many places where chorizo is served overly dry, these were perfectly moist and among the best I‚Äôve had in Singapore. The beef tartare was yet another well-executed dish, made with high-quality beef and seasoned to achieve that unmistakable note of indulgence.
To finish, we opted for a cheese platter and grilled peppers, both of which were enjoyable. However, the meal was not without its shortcomings. Our first bread basket included a decent sourdough, but alongside it was an inexplicably dry, hard-to-swallow piece that felt entirely out of place. Even more surprising was the absence of a proper baguette‚Äîan essential staple in any French dining experience. When we requested more bread, only the sourdough remained an acceptable option.Given the quality of their charcuterie and appetizers, the subpar bread felt like a glaring oversight that detracted from what was otherwise an excellent meal.
Overall, the restaurant delivers on flavor, technique, and ingredient quality, particularly in its cold and hot appetizer selection. However, for a French establishment, neglecting the bread selection is a misstep that should be addressed to elevate the dining experience to its full potential.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Atout/@1.3311585,103.7601466,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da19eb1211aa47:0x87a3e6e93b6e0a8d!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a224cd0312f:0xf1e5ed6e03f71b46!8m2!3d1.3059467!4d103.8136393!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgETZXVyb3BlYW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VORE4zUTNZV0ZuRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCL8FEDE!16s%2Fg%2F11gggzyl7p"

Min Jiang at Dempsey,R,"We reserved the private dining area with a minimum spend and ended up spending just over $3000 in total. The set menu, priced at $520 per table (for 6 people), offered a refined selection of dishes, including Beijing duck served with homemade crepes, double-boiled chicken soup, steamed sea perch, braised abalone, braised mee pok, and a dessert of mango sago with pomelo and vanilla ice cream.

Alongside the set menu, we added several √† la carte dishes to further explore the menu. Highlights included the crispy eel with vinegar sauce, crispy white bait fish with pork floss, and fried carrot cake with XO sauce. Other dishes like the Alaskan crab with steamed egg in truffle oil, deep-fried white corn pearl, and the braised fish maw with sea cucumber didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark, with some of them (such as the Alaskan crab) tasting more like imitation crabmeat.

The set menu portions were not particularly filling, especially given the additional a la carte orders, so it‚Äôs worth noting that you might need to order more if you‚Äôre looking for a more substantial meal. However, the standouts for me were the Beijing duck, double-boiled chicken soup, and steamed sea perch. These dishes truly elevated the meal.

A downside to the experience was the lack of soundproofing in the private dining area. The space was only separated by a rattan wooden door with holes, which led to a lack of privacy and noise from the surrounding restaurant. Additionally, the service was slow and the staff seemed stretched thin, which affected the overall dining experience.

Min Jiang at Dempsey,Eric Teh,"Really nice Cantonese restaurant in a cosy location that makes you feel like you are out of the country.

Service is really attentive and prompt with helpful suggestions on what to order, and portion size etc. The food quality is very high and some of the dishes are quite innovative. The dishes I ordered were,

1. Deluxe Dim Sum Platter

Imaginative and tasty selection of dim sum items. I enjoyed this, and the prawns used were nice and crunchy.

2. Double-boiled chicken soup with goldfish dumpling

Flavoursome stock with good clarity.

3. Double-boiled chicken soup with eel max and shrimp

This is a heavier and milky soup. Just as nice as #2, just different.

4. Pan-fried Kurobuta with melted onions

Nicely executed with the sauce and caramelised onions providing a good pairing with the pork.

5. Soaked rice with prawn, scallop and mushroom

The stock is quite prawn-forward. Good fresh ingredients. The very nice touch is that the puffed rice is served separately in a bowl which keeps it nice and crispy. The sizing is generous so you could probably have your crispies in every spoonful.

6. Iberico pork fried rice in pumpkin with XO sauce

A must-order in my opinion. Pretty near perfectly executed. Top marks for the XO sauce.

I did find it strange that they didn't offer ""normal"" Chinese tea. Their tea options will set you back a pretty penny. You know you are in trouble when you have a description of the individual estates. The alcohol menu is very impressive and interestingly quite competitively priced compared to the tea menu. Maybe I'm just not conditioned to paying so much for tea.

The waitress kindly reminded me of their credit card promotions, so I ended up saving a bit. That was a nice bonus because the food is quite expensive.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Min+Jiang+at+Dempsey/@1.3311585,103.7601466,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1a3cebff445d:0x220fcd276bfd65b2!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a5cafd1ae97:0x705739b2c488be87!8m2!3d1.3046255!4d103.808144!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWTU16bDRVR2xSY1VvM1RUUkJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECCAQQQ!16s%2Fg%2F11b6dzpy6h"

Micasa Kitchen & Bar,Dawn Hoh,"No more Next Time... First time dining here and never again returning. Reserved a table to buy a friend a birthday dinner. All was ok in the beginning. We ordered a bottle of wine, burrata, beef cheek stew and 3-ribs of lamb rack.

TBH, the food here is pretty decent. Until the lamb rack was served. My friend and I stared hard at the dish, specifically the meat to fat ratio. Since it was a birthday treat, my friend was polite and picked up a piece of lamb and began to eat it. I hesitated for a bit and finally decided to call it in. Told the staff that the proportion of fat to meat was more than 50%. I told her that it was unacceptable to serve customers this way without trimming off the fat, and on top of that, the dish is charged by the  weight of the lamb racks. I also referred her to Google pics of the same dish posted by other customers, who all got very nice cuts of meat. I requested for a change of meats. After all, I was there for this dish. We asked for the menu and was about to decide on a replacement dish when an elderly man, who looked like the owner of the restaurant came to our table to tell us that all lambs have fat, each differs in fat content.

Ok fine, it's not like my friend and I haven't eaten lamb racks before. But we never got served with such fat proportions before. I explained that I was very willing to pay for the meat with some fat but not 50% fat! Why can't I get the ones which his customers posted on Google?

We ended up with a lecture from his elderly man instead. Who replied ""Next time, if you are not happy with the dish, don't touch it."" I could feel my blood pressure go up at that point. And I told him to charge us for the eaten piece of rack. To which he said they will cancel this item from the bill, and repeated his lecture of ""Next time..."". We didn't want to engage him further. We finished up the rest of our beef cheek and took away our half consumed bottle of wine. The experience left a bad taste in our mouth. And to make it worse, an unpleasant birthday dinner.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Micasa+Kitchen+%26+Bar/@1.3407548,103.7364822,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1063d334b873:0xac91819027db1b0d!8m2!3d1.3407548!4d103.7725311!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESc3BhbmlzaF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU50YUhGcFdIVkJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCPABEEo!16s%2Fg%2F11cn9ljnpl"

Servers were attentive and helpful, and carried a generally friendly demeanour. The area was clean and very well-lit.

COLLIN'S¬Æ,Sam Toh (Sammy),"Collins Jurong Point is an absolute gem in the culinary landscape! From the moment I stepped in, I was captivated by its inviting ambiance and friendly staff. The menu offers a delightful fusion of flavors, showcasing an extensive range of dishes that cater to various palates.

Their attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the beautifully presented dishes to the impeccable service. The appetizers were a fantastic start, with the crispy calamari and flavorful bruschetta stealing the show.

For the main course, I opted for their signature Collins Steak, and it was a revelation! Cooked to perfection, the tender and succulent steak left me craving for more. The accompanying sides were equally impressive, providing a harmonious blend of textures and tastes.

The dessert menu was an indulgent treat. The molten lava cake was a chocolate lover's dream come true, while the tangy lemon tart provided a refreshing contrast.

Moreover, I must commend their attention to dietary preferences. They offer a diverse selection of vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring everyone can relish the experience.

Soh Kee Cooked Food,umake mehungry,"If one is talking about the recommended food stalls in Jurong West 505 Market & Food Centre, it's of no surprise that one of them will be Soh Kee Cooked Food.

Soh Kee Cooked Food has been serving delicious Cantonese style porridge ever since my childhood days. This stall has brought back a lot of memories in me ~ I still can remember the days when the lady will automatically provide a small empty bowl on top of my main bowl of steaming hot porridge without fail. That really helped a lot in separating the scalding hot bowl of porridge into a smaller bowl. It had left me a great impression as a child with the kind of warmth gesture offered.

Soh Kee Cooked Food is known for its Chicken Porridge. Nevertheless, they do offer chicken, fish, cuttlefish and mix porridge. The usual ones I had will be their Chicken Porridge followed by fish porridge.

Like many of the patrons, I cannot resist ordering their chicken porridge set. For a Two Pax Meal, the portion of poached chicken was considered generous.

The chicken was succulent, tender and moist. What's more, the wonderful mixture of soy and sesame sauce had elevated its taste.

Though this bowl of porridge is simple and down to earth without many ingredients like spring onions with white pepper. I honestly claimed that it does satiate my appetite even in its plainest form.

The porridge was served in perfect silky smooth watery consistency and had never failed to satisfy my meal. Every meal is an enjoyment for me. Ever since I had shifted out of Jurong, I'm still missing their porridge frequently.

Besides having the bowls of stomach warming porridge, another noteworthy item will be their Salad. They used to serve ""Yu Sheng"" but due to the with the advent of  Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections, such dish is no longer served due to NEA‚Äôs ban. Instead, the dish has been changed to Abalone Salad. The dish brings out a connotation of simplest items like abalone slices, scallions, shredded carrots with zesty and citrus taste including the user of crackers, enhancing the crunchiness in the bite.

In conclusion, Soh Kee Cooked Food has maintained its standard all these years and YES! I'm still loving it and that means I won't get bored even till the extent of having their food daily. On top of that if you are looking for healthier choices of food, their chicken, fish and cuttlefish porridge are indicated with the healtiher choice logo.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soh+Kee+Cooked+Food/@1.3394886,103.6691575,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da10035c32bc9f:0xdaff0db2e77cc6e6!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1aa5ba78f48f:0x28d9d94a57021d5a!8m2!3d1.349742!4d103.718509!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEMaGF3a2VyX3N0YWxsmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU4yY0MxRFJWaG5FQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQUIjAUQIw!16s%2Fg%2F1td9y63k"

The crab burger and Tofu fries was next. Burger was okay quite enjoyable and so was the Tofu fries with the dip sauce. I guess it was a good combination and the tofu fries would just seem kinda out of place by just ordering ala carte.
Last was the coffee pasta, which I thought was the ""disaster"" of the entire meal. Kinda hard to appreciate coffee taste on the pasta, which left a bitter aftertaste even after the meal. On the other hand the beef that went along with the pasta was so well cooked the meat was very tender and juicy.

For some reason the shop forgot the duck and rice, hahas. But all is good. They made another trip to deliver to us when we called the outlet. Normally I would prefer a refund to avoid the hassle but we didn‚Äôt order a lot that day and would prefer to have the food.

The lotus root is still very crispy yum yum.

I had the cajun chicken this time and the set lunch came with a iced (lemon) tea. Added a soup of the day as I wanted more sustenance. You can add more sides and other stuff at a slight discount.

My cajun chicken was well marinated and thoroughly cooked BUT there was just too much flour/batter.

I would appreciate it if it was for my fish n chips but it got cloying until I had to scrap it off. I know there are others who'd like that, but not me. So I apologise to the cashier when I made payment. It's unlike me to waste food but I wasn't feeling too well.

UPDATE: 01.11.2024
grilled chicken salad before and after photos.
portions too small for the price.

UPDATE: 02.25.2024
food: ordered NZ striploin. meat was grilled straight from the freezer. hard as rubber. no taste as well. not even properly seasoned. ordered medium, given medium well. well done good job.

service: find it annoying that the servers has to go rounds (meaning every minute), have to watch someone eat, immediately take empty plates on the table even though people havent finished the whole course yet.

atmosphere: noisy as its directly at the back of an arcade center.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hot+Tomato/@1.3394886,103.6691575,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0fecc69bedb1:0xd320a963d6053fe4!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0fecdb103549:0x7490b2e9f8b5a247!8m2!3d1.3395673!4d103.7067965!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSMkxUUmlhVWRuRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCKYCEEQ!16s%2Fg%2F11g5zyrf7r"

The service was excellent, with staff frequently checking on our orders and keeping the table clean. The warm lights above each table beautifully illuminated the dishes, making them look even more appetizing.

81 Seafood Restaurant,Sheryl Lee,"Food is not too bad. Though they do not take phone call reservations seriously, won't even ask for your name, or keep a record. I called in on 12 June to book a table for 14 June (Sat), told them specifically that we would like to be seated indoors and repeated myself to ensure that they heard me. My mum called on that day itself to change the timing to half an hour later than our original booking, same thing, they did not bother to ask for names, or anything at all to verify the person on the other end of the line. We did not think much of it at this point, however, when we reached, we were told to sit outdoors. They took a long time to verify our booking, and they looked confused. I had to show them my phone call log, with the date of calling etc. This is the first time I've seen an eatery handling reservations this way.
Not forgetting, the food is overpriced as well, for this price I could order more food elsewhere. It was great the first time, hence we went back for a second time for Father's Day celebration. It was disappointing for most of the dishes.
It is not easy to get the staff member's attention, as they avoid looking at you when you have your arm raised. One younger looking lady even avoided us when we had our arms raised, not sure if she deliberately did that or not. The service is bad as well, they will go over your head to serve the food, leaning in so close you will get into contact with them if you move back a little. They serve food at their own convenience, they will simply squeeze themselves right between you and the person sitting beside you, instead of approaching from an empty space where no one is seated.

Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant,Pauline Wee,"Tried ÂçóËÆ∞ for the first time today and was genuinely surprised. The weather was super hot, so we decided to give this place a try since it‚Äôs air-conditioned and that already made it a comfortable dining experience!

At first, we weren‚Äôt expecting much because it wasn‚Äôt crowded during lunch, but the food turned out to be really good. We had the steamed chicken rice (roasted was already sold out must be popular!), and it was tender, tasty, and the rice was fragrant without being oily. Each of us also got a bowl of soup, which was comforting and full of flavour.

One of the highlights was their chilli, it packed a good punch! Plus, they provided free flow ginger and dark soy sauce in bottles on the table, which is great for those who love their condiments.

Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant,Isobel Tan,"Am not sure why we didn‚Äôt know about this place earlier. I love a good plate of chicken rice, and Nam Kee certainly ranks up there for offering precisely that.

We came here for dinner after a run around Jurong Lake Gardens, since you can park at the open air carpark at Super Bowl.

The restaurant is air-conditioned and really comfortable, and the staff are very friendly and helpful.

We ordered half a poached chicken, sweet and sour pork, the home made prawn rolls and the chicken rice.

Everything was delicious. The poached chicken was tender and juicy, and tasty even without any sauce. In any case, the free flow dark soy sauce and chilli were still there to elevate the flavour. The rice was also really flavourful and was perfect to pair with the chicken. As with other traditional chicken rice restaurants, your chicken rice comes with free refillable chicken soup, which was such a comfort for the evening.

They also do tze char dishes in case you want more variety. The sweet and sour pork and prawns rolls were both good as well.

The food also came pretty fast.

Tried the fried Rice before. While it looks nice, it‚Äôs tasteless and flat. Very little meat also. Definitely not worth the price paid.

I ordered the striploin steak a medium rare and ordered a coffee along with it. An ice lemon tea came instead and the steak was pretty much well done.

Trattoria da Mimmo Restaurant and Pizzeria,Terence Oh,"Can you come here for absolutely delicious calamari, spaghetti carbonara, and four cheese pizza?  Of course you can, and you will enjoy perfectly made, hearty country style cooking served in family sized portions. The chef makes every ingredient shine.  The beef tripe is fresh and beefy, the pork is hearty and sweet, and the tomato paste is perfectly balanced.  The pizza also has probably the softest, fluffiest base we've had.

The thrill is to ask about the specials of the day, and this is where the chef's style absolutely shines through.  Every special we've tried had been absolutely delicious concoctions that we've not had in other Italian restaurants, made with seasonally available ingredients.

Service here is friendly and impeccable.

From the moment you step inside, you‚Äôre greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy, rustic ambiance that transports you straight to Italy.

Food ‚Äì 10/10

The menu offers a fantastic selection of classic Italian dishes, each crafted with high-quality ingredients and rich, traditional flavors. We started with their Burrata with Parma Ham, which was fresh, creamy, and paired perfectly with the delicate saltiness of the ham. The Seafood Risotto was a standout ‚Äì rich, creamy, and packed with fresh prawns, scallops, and mussels. The homemade pasta dishes, especially the Truffle Carbonara and Lobster Ravioli, were absolute perfection.

And let‚Äôs talk about their wood-fired pizzas ‚Äì thin, crispy, and loaded with flavor. The Diavola Pizza had the perfect kick of spice, and the Quattro Formaggi was indulgently cheesy without being overpowering.

For dessert, the Tiramisu was heavenly ‚Äì light, creamy, and just the right balance of coffee and mascarpone. We also loved the Panna Cotta, which was smooth, velvety, and paired with a delightful berry compote.

Service ‚Äì 10/10

The service was impeccable. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, happily recommending dishes and wine pairings. They truly made us feel welcome, checking in just the right amount without being intrusive.

Ambiance ‚Äì 9/10

The restaurant has a charming, intimate vibe, perfect for a romantic dinner, a cozy family gathering, or even a casual get-together with friends. Soft lighting, tasteful decor, and Italian music in the background make for an inviting atmosphere.

Value for Money ‚Äì 9/10

For the quality of food and service, Madrinaa Italiano is well worth the price. Portions are generous, and every dish is made with care and authenticity.

Barrio Spanish Restaurant,Empress Ker,"On July 24th, I received a call from Barrio, Liqi; the operation manager from the group, to apologize for the previous issues I raised. I appreciate the call and the opportunity to express my concerns. It‚Äôs clear that Barrio is committed to maintaining high standards in the food industry. As a result, I will adjust my star review. Thank you!

20th July
To the owner of the restaurant,

Thank you for the delicious food and the freshly prepared dishes from the kitchen. We ordered several items, and I particularly enjoyed the roast cauliflower, paella, and sandwich. However, I wish the grilled prawns had been cooked a bit more, as they were somewhat undercooked.

Unfortunately, my family and I had a disappointing or experience with your server, Daniel. I even took a picture of him. I believe he would need additional training; he seemed unwelcoming and appeared curt when we request for additional things or when we ask questions. When we arrive 1140am, he was busy with his face gluing to the iPad and side facing us and make us wait at the door. When we said Hi, he gives us an extremely lukewarm and unwelcoming face and I already felt very taken back ..

Additionally, he was not prompt or attentive. While I like the food, I will not return due to the subpar service we received. The restaurant was warm in the afternoon, and your server appeared more focused on standing at the door rather than checking in with the tables to see if assistance was needed. We even had to stand up and take our finished plates to the counter, as well as fetch our own forks and hot sauce.

I rarely write reviews like this, but I felt compelled to do so, especially since it was my husband's birthday , clearly written in my Chope message and we left feeling dissatisfied, particularly with the service.

Your price is not cheap too.. Thus, please spend some effort and to train your waiter.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barrio+Spanish+Restaurant/@1.3315214,103.7714569,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da10a5d6076a27:0x29a05227ec0efe7e!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da11831fc84381:0x4b4a60f7c632ef75!8m2!3d1.3315214!4d103.8075058!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESc3BhbmlzaF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJLTmpsWVpVWjNFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABBJ!16s%2Fg%2F11ssf8_mf5"

Lazy Lizard - The Promenade,Daniel Goh,"Neighbourhood gem that‚Äôs worth supporting! Food and service were way above expectations.

We chanced upon the cafe with google map‚Äôs recommendations and were attracted by the Kids Eat Free promotion on weekends / PHs. For less than a hundred dollars, we enjoyed the squid ink risotto ($20.80), classic ribeye ($32.80), pint of beer, tiramisu and ice cream, with a kids shrimp pasta and fish and chips!

The squid ink risotto was 10/10 in terms of taste and value. While the ribeye could be a little thicker for a better bite, the sear was done right and served medium rare like we asked. Tomato sauce on the shrimp pasta was on point.

While the setup seemed to suggest a beer garden vibes, most diners seemed to be families or older couples out for a simple meal. We very much enjoyed the place and will certainly be back to try their rack of pork and other mains.

Good Bites,Chew Chee Chin,"The outdoor waiting area has a desert-inspired aesthetic, featuring a large illuminated moon backdrop, cacti, and tropical plants. Canvas camping chairs add an adventurous, bohemian feel.
‚Ä¢
Inside, the bistro has a modern tropical vibe with woven rattan chairs, white marble tabletops, and warm wooden flooring, creating a laid-back and inviting atmosphere.
‚Ä¢
When the food arrived, the first thing we noticed was the massive portions!
‚Ä¢
We started with a shrimp salad, a refreshing appetizer that added bits of seafood and more greens to balance out the meal.
‚Ä¢
For mains, we had the shiok burger, grilled free-range chicken, Cajun lamb chop, and pasta aglio olio (turkey bacon & chicken ham).
‚Ä¢
My favorite was the shiok burger‚Äîthe crispy crust on the chicken thigh patty, paired with chili crab sauce, made it extremely addictive.
‚Ä¢
The proteins, like chicken thigh and lamb chop, came with a generous serving of assorted greens, making the meal well-balanced.
‚Ä¢
The molten chocolate lava cake and signature waffle with ice cream were classic and satisfying, the perfect sweet ending to our feast.
‚Ä¢
To accompany our meal, we had iced teas in passionfruit mango earl grey, lychee & orange earl grey, and raspberry mint earl grey flavors.
‚Ä¢
Each came beautifully garnished, and the staff informed us that they would be slightly sweet, so we paced ourselves with sips throughout the meal.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Good+Bites/@1.3555789,103.8152807,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da171a1eb4d81b:0xe84b5a1d5e34d2c9!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da172a10a45b51:0x80558c3ee2c43396!8m2!3d1.3555789!4d103.8513296!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEEY2FmZZoBRENpOURRVWxSUVVOdlpFTm9kSGxqUmpsdlQyNW9NMUpXUmxWVk1HUnVVVmMwZVV4WE9WVk1WbWhOVXpOck1sZEhZeEFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECCEQOw!16s%2Fg%2F11fl0cm5d0"

The reno was pretty nice and good lightings for western dining. Staff are helpful if you require their help to take physical order (rather than QR code ordering) A good selection of mains and drinks (including Twinings hot tea that comes in a small pot)

You have to try their side dish- brussel sprouts- it was crunchy with a light sweet sauce that went well with it. No bitterness.

I didn‚Äôt expect the mixed grill came exactly like in menu photo- a rather large stone platform. It was good for photos lolll! But some may find it difficult to eat from it- but there is nothing you can‚Äôt resolve if you ask for a side plate.

We had 3 mains, a lychee drink and a hot tea. The bill came up to about $100 plus. Joining Collin‚Äôs as member is free- all you have to do is to download their app and get your account set up. I enrolled as a new member and got 5% off straight away and the final damaged was about $98 üëçüèª

Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - WestGate,Ming Shen Tham,"Dropped by Brotzeit at WestGate for a casual meal and drinks, and overall, it was a decent experience.

We started with the oysters ($3 per piece, with a minimum order of six). They were relatively plump and fresh enough to enjoy. For the mains, I had the chicken schnitzel, which was alright but nothing to rave about. The potato wedges were a pleasant surprise‚Äîwell-seasoned and not soggy, just the way they should be.

Unfortunately, the rosti was a letdown. It came out cold, hard, and rather tasteless, which was disappointing considering it‚Äôs typically a comforting, crispy dish.

That said, Brotzeit still serves as a good spot to hang out and grab a drink with friends, especially if you‚Äôre not expecting mind-blowing food.

At first this place didn't really catch my eye among all the Japanese places in jem since it was managed by donki. But oh man, did I miss out on a great restaurant that is even better than other better known chains.

Firstly the restaurant had the typical conveyor belt Japanese restaurant vibe. Almost similar to sushiro or Kura. But! It stands out so much better in terms of the food quality and even quantity. The sushi pieces looked fresher and thicker. I was super surprised by the size of the chirashi bowl. It had a really good amount that needed 2 people to finish. Typically if you order this bowls from sushiro those types of places, it comes in a smaller sized portion, almost like it's a side dish. Over here it is like a main dish!

City Hot Pot @ Jurong Point,Ê®ÇFun Homestay,"We reserved a table of 3 to celebrate our friend's birthday.  The restaurant opens for dinners at 5pm but unknowingly I arrived earlier around 4.50pm as I wanted to pass them a birthday cake to be served as a surprise for my friend.  The lady who was busy preparing food (Jessica if I got her name correctly) was very helpful to help me to keep the cake first while I went off to meet my friends.  When we returned to the restaurant, the staff was very fast to lead us to our table.

We took quite a while to decide our order but their staff made it a breeze for us explaining what are the promotions and options.  At the end, we decided to order 2 pax Set D seafood and drinks.  The portion is actually sufficient for 3 of us. The seafood, meat, veggies etc all very fresh.  Free helpings to their wide varieties of sauce, kimchi, pickles and fruits.  The water melon was super sweet.  The staff also kept helping us to refill the different soups we have ordered.

Subsequently we received a call from another friend saying she and hubby could join us for dinner too.  Jessica and her team immediately helped to shift us to another bigger table.  My friend and hubby ordered their 1 for 1 promo meal.  The portions of wagyu ribeye/beef were very generous and nicely sliced.  Their veggies and handmade yong tau fu baskets were beautifully displayed and sumptuous too.

Jessica besides asking her team to clean up the table before bringing the cake out, she personally helped to sing 3 versions of birthday songs (English/Chinese/Cantonese) with background music playing.  We are highly impressed by the standard of service by Jessica and her team.

Thank you for making our gathering such a memorable one!",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/City+Hot+Pot+@+Jurong+Point/@1.3399257,103.6702397,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0fecd25e0a09:0xd320a963d92f0250!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0fc3284489d5:0x88ce49a833104dca!8m2!3d1.3392308!4d103.7069174!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESaG90X3BvdF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5UVVJKTkdGRFNEUkJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCLMJEEc!16s%2Fg%2F11rhqqj4yf"

Mother Earth Vegetarian Restaurant Â§ßÂú∞‰πãÁ¥†,John Lee,"Firstly, I didn‚Äôt expect a restaurant where you have to take your own plates and utensils, and even wipe your own table. If I could give a rating lower than zero, I‚Äôd give it -100. What kind of logic is this‚Äîcalling it a restaurant but making it self-service?

And to top it off, they still had the nerve to add a 20% surcharge for CNY Eve. Understand that is CNY charges but come on such services trash.

Worst experience ever, Honestly, should I even pay that when everything is self-service?

There was a moment when all of our dishes had been cleared, but the new ones hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. When they finally brought the new dishes, they just stood there holding them, waiting for us to clear the space ourselves?

Even if it‚Äôs self-service, they could‚Äôve informed us about it beforehand, not after the dishes arrive, when we have to walk over and ask. It‚Äôs basic customer service to let your guests know in advance, and that‚Äôs something any restaurant or service crew should do.

Don‚Äôt use excuses like ‚Äútoo many people‚Äù or ‚Äúlack of staff‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs not the customer‚Äôs issue, it‚Äôs the restaurant‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt shift your problems onto the customers.

Kay-Tu Myanmar Cuisine - Pioneer,lontongstroong,"Stumbled this stall by chance in Google Map. There's another stall by the same name in Boon Lay Market around a kilometer away that sells identical items and menu, which is a newer branch of this eatery (covered in separate review). Seems to make sense since many members of the Burmese diaspora live and work in the West area.

Tried some of the items I haven't tried from the previous visits to the Boon Lay Market outlet - namely mutton curry, banana blossom stew with coconut milk, coconut milk noodle (onno kaw shwe), and some veggie fritters which looks like Indian pakora (and samosa). All tastes from okay to great, but personally some items like the oily meat dishes are better to be consumed as treats instead of daily meal (for obvious reason). Price tends to be on steeper side - above $5 except perhaps the fritters that fetches $3 for 4 pieces.

What would I recommend? I‚Äôm not sure because everything was super good tbh, depends on your food preference.
- Stir fried pork is their must order signature dish.
- Spicy cold noodle dish is good for sharing
- Claypot tofu (non spicy version) was interesting. It‚Äôs more like beancurd skin in tofu shape, it was good. We got non spicy to balance out the other spicy dishes
- Cauliflower was good, they used a lot of pork lard and garlic so it was really savory.
- Tea oil beef was spicy but fragrant, sooo much garlic that I love inside!
- Eggplant was cooked well and soaked with yummy sauce
- Sour spicy fish soup is one of the best around. It‚Äôs so addictive as it‚Äôs not too spicy, and they add lemon slices in it for a refreshing twist
- Shredded potato was nice and crunchy!
- Luffa dish was lighter compared to the other strong dishes we ordered but a nice complement.

Overall, we enjoyed the food and finished everything. There‚Äôs free flow crackers and ice cream available at the self serve area.

Interesting menu selection, such as the Antler mushroom braised chicken (tender meat & flavourful soup, we like it so much, there wasn‚Äôt enough to go around!), Golden broth sour & spicy fish (nice sourness from the lemon but very spicy), & Iberico pork belly & fore shank. The Stir-fry organic cauliflower was quite sweet & fresh too.

Most of the items come with the option to make it non-spicy, which makes it kids-friendly. There‚Äôs also free-flow ice cream & snacks at the entrance!

Uncle Leong Signatures,Edwin Ng,"Was totally disturbed by the service of this outlet. But only to one specific person. I refer to the person whom I had asked around other staff if she is the supervisor, and they said yes, and to highlight she is the supervisor (chinese speaking Vietnamese lady). Here's how it went down.

Was browsing the menu at the door when the supervisor came to ask if we (my spouse & I) wanted to take a seat. As we were still considering, we told her we would just take a look first, we went on looking around the food court and eventually decided upon Uncle Leong. After we were seated, we decided on the 2 pax set menu when I raised my hands to get the attention of the service crew, which happens to be the supervisor. I asked about the poster on the table of scanning the qr code for a $1 drink.

The issues
1. The poster states only coconut, ah yu jelly, etc. I pointed out to the supervisor, and immediately, I was rebutted. ""Oh, it's up to us to decide what drinks to offer, so now changed to this this and this,"" pointing to the drinks menu.

Woah, I sound like a cheap skate freebie hunter at this point.

2. My wife decided on the choice with the set and placed her order. At this point, the supervisor seems to be irritated with our order speed and proceeded to say she will go send the order first while my wife finishes scanning the qr code.

We started to wonder if we weren't qualified to be eating at this restaurant ü§î.  Maybe what we ordered is not those of the higher class dishes.

3. Drinks served wrong, we ordered a lime juice & a peach tea, came 2 lime. The other server at this time was great üëç thumbs up for him (prc guy). He quickly apologised and brought us the changed drink.

Food choice we served wrong, one of the bean curd we ordered was the hotplate, but came Á∫¢ÁÉß. We decided not to be picky about it and just ate what was served.

The order was taken by the supervisor. This obviously shows how interested is she on her work.

4. Next table hoo Haa. Overheard the conversation of another table with the same supervisor. The other table ordered 2 set meals, but the supervisor specifically said that she keyed in already, she cannot revert. It seems to me that the other table had ordered 2 set meals for 3 to 4 pax. But I was already causing some confusion. I saw the same irritated side eye roll of the supervisor...

5. The second table commotion, a couple came in again attended by the dame supervisor, this time they were talking about voucher or promos they had bought online. What again that attracted me was, the supervisor exclaimed, ""This I can't decide! I'll call my management and let them speak to you.""

The ironic part is that after she called the management, she passed the mobile to the customer, and she went around gossiping and pointing towards the table of the customer holding her mobile. How rude!

To wrap this up. If a business that fails at any one point, this ""Supervisor"" is the cause of all the reputation, the chefs effort, discredited the other kind service or the other crew. Straight to the point, she behaves as if she's a successful business owner (maybe she really is) that does not need our poor peasants business.

What an unpleasant dinner experience we've had that spoils my whole evening. I hope the other tables also put up  a review so that it does justify what I've been through and witness.

To be fair, other than this supervisor, I have no issue with the taste of the food. The other service crews attitude were good too. I guess it up to the management to re-educate the customer service of your staff. Or you may attempt to write a ""look into the matter"" to brush away my elaborated review. Let's see how it all works out again when we return.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uncle+Leong+Signatures/@1.3272183,103.6424966,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da058035291067:0xdeeac7a76de8a9b5!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da15fce6a8b8d5:0x54f0a89edb433561!8m2!3d1.3272183!4d103.6785455!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESY2hpbmVzZV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU55YzB4SGRXcEJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQKw!16s%2Fg%2F11c547mps0"

Domino's Pizza,Nicholas Loo,"‚∏ª

Disappointed with the In-Store Experience on 5 June

I visited the store on 5 June at around 12 PM, intending to place an order at the counter. Despite two staff members being inside, no one acknowledged me or offered any assistance while I stood waiting. It wasn‚Äôt until I had to call out to them that I was told to scan a QR code and place my order online.

This was extremely frustrating and felt dismissive. I had purposely come down to order in person, but instead was made to go through the hassle of signing in digitally just to get a pizza. If customers aren‚Äôt allowed to place orders at the counter, then what is the point of having one?

The entire experience felt impersonal and inconvenient. I hope Domino‚Äôs reconsiders this system and allows walk-in customers the option of ordering directly with staff.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Domino's+Pizza/@1.3470348,103.6444482,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0fe0009f1891:0x88a548cc8892054f!8m2!3d1.3466913!4d103.6859655!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEUZmFzdF9mb29kX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblRVUnZkR1p1YjBGM0VBRaoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAEDw!16s%2Fg%2F11v9g3nct1"
Domino's Pizza,Edson Tandoc,"After ordering online and more than 30 unanswered calls, I had to come down to the NTU branch in person just to confirm if my order went through; this very much defeats the purpose of online ordering and delivery. There was no email confirmation, nothing on the app either. To say this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced in Singapore will be an understatement. This is also not the first bad experience I have with Dominos SG. I first had a bad experience when it just opened at NTU years ago. I wanted to support it. Since then, I have not ordered from Dominos SG. But I thought that years later maybe it has improved. Nope. It is just as bad as before. Apparently, I am not the only one complaining.

Domino's Pizza,pritha m,"I am extremely frustrated with the service I received. I ordered $60 worth of food from Domino's NTU on FoodPanda at 5 PM, with an estimated delivery time of 40-60 minutes. However, after an hour, I still hadn't received my food. I attempted to call the store multiple times but no one answered. Additionally, I couldn‚Äôt reach anyone through the FoodPanda app since it stated that the food was being delivered by the outlet‚Äôs driver and couldn‚Äôt be tracked.
Another hour passed, making it two hours since I placed my order, and I had still received no updates. The app still showed my food was ‚Äúpreparing.‚Äù Finally, I was able to get through to someone at the outlet, but he sounded unsure and was unable to provide any useful information. He took my details, mentioned that the driver had been sent, and then said the food had been placed at the lobby . When I told him I hadn‚Äôt received any food or communication, he took my details again and promised to call me back after checking. However, no one ever called me back.
I then went to check in person, and to my disbelief, the food had been left outside on top of a fire safety box for over an hour without any notification. I called the outlet again and explained the situation, but the staff member(ANN)  defended the store's actions and claimed the driver had delivered the food. She also said most workers are old and might not understand, which is completely unacceptable.
I am thoroughly disgusted with this terrible service. Since the food had been left outside for over an hour in a fire safety box, it was no longer safe to consume. This is not the first time I‚Äôve had issues with this outlet.

3. Several slices were burnt and overcooked.

4. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but it ended up taking 45 minutes.

5. Their phone line was odd; when someone picked up, we could still hear the dial tone, and the call suddenly cut off mid-conversation.

The chicken dishes are clearly the stars on the menu and what they're famous for. Speaking of which, they have an extensive menu with locally inspired and international flavored dishes.

Kotobuki,Ryan Fernandez,"Definitely not your usual conveyor Japanese restaurant. We chanced on this hidden gem, located in the western part of Singapore. We ordered the salmon belly sashimi (Sake Harami) to share. Dish came with 6 slices of sashimi. The slices were thick and fresh. Immediately melted in my mouth. Damn delicious. Wifey and me then ordered a Deluxe Kaisen Don each. It‚Äôs a rice dish with egg, crab sticks, raw scallops, prawns, tuna and salmon. Topped with I believe salmon roe and uni (sea urchin).

You Le Tian Seafood Restaurant,YY,"My favourite tzechar go to in Singapore, tucked away in a corner of a bustling
neighbourhood.

Food
The beancurd is a must order, crispy yet tender at the same time, paired with the sauce, it‚Äôs heavenly.
The chicken in the photos is a limited time offer, which is made up of seafood paste, without chicken meat, just the skin.

Price
It was honestly much cheaper (like 20-30% lower) a year or two ago. I guess the recent renovation works added to the rising cost which is passed downwards to us consumers. 4 of us, feasting on a crab, a fish, limited edition ‚Äúchicken‚Äù, beancurd, broccoli with scallop and long beans cost us $160 ü§î

All in all, still the go to place whenever we feel for tzechar. Would recommend making reservations during weekends though.

Acqua e Farina - Italian Pizza & Pasta Restaurant . Rail Mall,Qian Le Sze,"the focaccia (first serving complimentary) is flat like a naan not sure why, tastes decent but had better at swissotel‚Äôs Prego. It‚Äôs free so I shall not nitpick on it.

the mains were great though, the pasta was really nice, tasted like something my italian grandma would cook if I had an italian grandma and it just felt homely and rustic. pizza was great, but I don‚Äôt know why they can‚Äôt cut 6 slices for us since there were six of us. they die die just want to cut 8 slices erm ok lol. Not sure why that is so difficult. Pasta portions are on the smaller side. Expected more for that pricing tbh. Steak‚Äôs okay, chef did a salt bae demonstration for us but personally felt a little underseasoned.

Pasta‚Äôs in the $30-40 range, can‚Äôt remember the price for pizza but similar-ish to the pasta. Steak‚Äôs $80. Not cheap but worth it the price point.

Overall I would definitely come again to relive my imaginary Italian grandma‚Äôs cooking

Ordered three dishes and was thoroughly disappointed with the overall quality and preparation.
‚Ä¢	Green Curry: Watery and overly dominated by coconut milk, lacking any real green curry flavor. The brinjal was undercooked‚Äîpractically raw. We returned it and requested a re-cook, but the second version wasn‚Äôt much better. It still tasted more like coconut water than curry.
‚Ä¢	Tom Yum Soup: Lacked depth‚Äîneither spicy nor sour. Ingredients were minimal: just two prawns, some frozen-tasting chicken pieces, and potato squid. Felt like shortcuts were taken with the broth.
‚Ä¢	Fried Thai Egg: While flavorful, it was excessively oily and heavy.

803 Thai Food (803Ê≥∞ÂõΩÂ∞èÂêÉ @ Upper Jurong Road,pauline yow,"Friend say heard about this stall and wanted to try.. came to eat around 8pm..

Had the lousiest Thai food here in this coffeeshop. Do not waste your calories for this.. This shop took over the zichar place which was decent.. sad max.. previously this stall was a smaller store in same coffeeshop.

My first time trying this stall and totally regretted it.. pls be patient for my long review..

Location.. store is in a typical coffeeshop.. nothing more can be said.. close to heartlands..

Price.. more expensive than ur typical hawker fare.. at first thought that the price would be justified by the quality.. $9 for a small kangkong, 6.50 for basil chicken and egg is typically what I would pay for zichar.. tomyam soup was at $8.. would pay willingly for decent fare..

Taste of food
Goodness. Help. I dont know to complain to store owner or not.. im a typical Chinese who was brought up to clean off my plate to not have wastage.. but omg.. the food was so bad tt I could not swallow my dinner..  see the remains of my dinner that I cannot stomach cause it was so horrendous.. I kid you not. More than half my plate and a full bowl of soup was left untouched.

First dish served was the basil chicken w rice and fried egg. Asked for totally cooked egg and the staff promised it to be cooked.. but served the runny side up with raw eggwhite on top of the yolk.. not how I like my eggs to be.. ok nvm..

Taste of the basil chicken.. it tasted like the basil chicken went for a swim in water and plunged itself into my plate. Whole dish was wet like a pond.. chicken tasted weird as if it was kept frozen and reheated when ordered.. meat tasted old and extra tough.. not sure what went wrong..

Second dish came the kangkong.. fried got wokhei.. not too bad.. but the seasoning was off and had no taste towards the end.. it tasted like salt was sprinkled on the top but it wasn't seasoned at the bottom after u ate the top portion off..

Last was the Tom yum goong which was damn oily with preserved food such as crabstick and fish cake.. and 1 small pathetic prawn that was dried and soaked till it was wrinkly..

Tasted one mouth of the soup and immediately questioned my life.. it was sweeter than coconut red Ruby dessert. Totally cannot take another spoonful of this sweet dessert.. wonder if I ordered the wrong item.. only took a spoonful of the soup.. whole bowl wasted.. sweet like dessert.. I've had my share of tomyumgoong.. dont try to tell me is the coconut taste.. it is totally wrong..

30mins into the meal, everything was left half untouched.. was damn hungry but the only good thing was the egg.. my photo show the wastage that I cannot stomach due to the quality of food.. for the price of $30, I would expect decent food.. I dun mind if it was not as nice as sanook or nakhon.. but at least make it edible...",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/803+Thai+Food+(803%E6%B3%B0%E5%9B%BD%E5%B0%8F%E5%90%83+@+Upper+Jurong+Road/@1.3294921,103.6461398,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0f7f83fa12e1:0xc9083ff7bb9eb0de!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1105bf651bef:0xc8e5e72a5e14a42b!8m2!3d1.3294921!4d103.6821887!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEMaGF3a2VyX3N0YWxsmgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5QTW5GSFR6UjNSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCN8CEEU!16s%2Fg%2F11p5qnbj13"

Tomidou Singapore,SY Ong,"Dined at Tomidou recently and was pleasantly surprised by the exquisite tuna and sea urchin sushi. It practically melted in my mouth, and the rice was perfectly seasoned. I inquired with the chef and learned that all ingredients are air freighted from Japan, ensuring exceptional freshness. The restaurant's decor, some of which is the chef's own collection from Japan, adds to the authenticity. The highlight, though, was a delightful combination of various tuna cuts and sea urchin wrapped in seaweed offering a delightful medley of textures and flavors, enhanced by soy sauce and wasabi. The chef is generous with the portion. My meal continued with a delectable miso soup featuring sweet and fresh clams. For dessert I indulged in handmade hojicha ice cream made by one of the chefs which was both pure and fragrant providing a refreshing end to the meal.

Tomidou Singapore,Jace Ong,"Had an extremely enjoyable experience at Tomidou! The chefs and restaurant staff went above and beyond to make our omakase meal a special experience, taking the time to explain the source and choice of ingredients used and even finding out the answers to any queries we may have. Do note that the establishment is reservation only, so do call ahead to book to avoid disappointment!

Dish 1: Tuna sushi from Ooma city, which is famed for their bluefin tuna.  The tuna melts in your mouth and the rice was perfectly done; how the chef managed to get individual grains of rice while still making them stick together escapes me. Ratio of rice to fish to wasabi to sauce was perfect.

Dish 2: Uni sushi from Hokkaido. The uni was very creamy, carrying a mild taste of the sea and complemented the smoky fragrance of the seaweed, which had been roasted over binchotan.

Dish 3: Rice dish with grilled fish, served with sauce from crab and Yuzu. The fragrance from the grilled fish and seaweed complemented the umami sauce. My favourite dish of the meal.

Dish 4: Toromaki made with ootoro, chuutoro and uni. Every bite managed to deliver a different flavour; the creamy uni was first to melt in your mouth, followed by ootoro the chuutoro. All the different ingredients managed to keep their unique flavours while still being cohesive as a dish.

5. Miso soup made with Shijimi clams, served delicately in a cute cup. The clams lends itself to a rich complex soup taste while still being light enough to be a comfort sip at the end of the day

6. Hojicha ice cream served in an elegant glass bowl.

Hong Kong Kitchen,Sabrina Tang,"Uncooked food and misleading. Terrible, horrible experience. Would have given 0 stars if possible.

Drunken chicken (~$10++) was overcooked, meat texture is like a few days old or boiled in soup before, small portion and hot (its supposed to be a cold dish). Sauce had no taste of alcohol at all. I have tasted several qualities of drunken chicken before and this is definitely 100% NOT drunken chicken.

When we approached the waitress and waiter to clarify about the food, they insisted that the drunken chicken was in fact drunken chicken. Refused to change. Refused to refund too. Waitress offered to get the chef out to clarify but he never came out.

BBQ scallop ($5++ each) was raw and undercooked. Potential food poisoning hazard. NEA, please note. My cousin, who is pregnant, was about to eat the entire scallop but her mother noticed that the scallop was undercooked. The implications of eating raw uncooked frozen seafood during pregnancy is dire.

Regarding the scallop, they refused to give a new one and only gave the option of re-heating the scallop they served. Talk about customer service.

Restaurant name is È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ∞èÂé® (hong kong kitchen) but the dishes were not hong kong style but mainland chinese style. Totally misleading. But that aside, how could a restaurant serve such bad/low standard of food?

Will not go again.

Margarita's Dempsey Hill,oscar,"went for a weekend lunch, wasn't too crowded and decor made it a very homely and cosy environment in general. most of the food looked mouth-watering and tasted even better. ordered their quesadillas and added $3 for beef, kitchen sink burrito, tiramisu cake and a lime margerita. in my opinion, their quesadillas are a must with their generous cheese, meat and dips. burrito was basically the quesadillas but with shredded cheese instead of melted cheese and with spinach rice wrapped inside which i thought was decent but not as tasty as their quesadillas. however, the tiramisu did not meet our expectations partly due to the amount of compliments we've seen of it online, which set our bar high for it. it did not have a ""strong coffee"" taste at all as seen its description and we couldn't taste the kahlua coffee liquor AT ALL which was really disappointing. as for the margerita, it was slightly on the diluted side and a fresh lime would have been better instead of the dried lime which didn't really give it the citrus flavour.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Margarita's+Dempsey+Hill/@1.3039682,103.7741702,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a234cb3f8b1:0xe1da5ec575538156!8m2!3d1.3039682!4d103.8102191!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESbWV4aWNhbl9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU50WDA1NlpuSm5SUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQJA!16s%2Fg%2F1v_v_xf6"
Botanico at The Summerhouse,Pau-Lin Ngen,"An amazing and romantic way to spend our last night visiting Singapore !

High points include the great service by our server Naresh who was very entertaining to talk to and gave great energy to our fun night . The food was decadent and rich and near perfection - all flavours were incredible and the dishes were seasoned perfectly . I wish the scallop dish was brought out separate from the cold starters as by the time we got to the scallop, it was cold but still delectable . My boyfriend had the wagyu beef steak as the main and he said it was the very definition of ‚Äúmelt in your mouth ‚Äú - I‚Äôm not a steak person (I chose the cod as my main) but even I had to admit the steak was the best I‚Äôve ever tried in my life!  I‚Äôve gone to a lot of fancier restaurants like this but for my boyfriend it was his first experience at a restaurant like this and he enjoyed every single dish that we were served for our 5 course meal!

As for some points of criticism:

I reserved the garden dome and it was very pretty and private - only half of the inside of the dome had fairy lights which was unfortunate as having more fairy lights would have made the interior that much more magical as I absolutely love beautiful lighting (the exterior lighting was spot-on).  The AC unit inside the dome was hard do control - at times it was too cold and other times we had issues turning it on or regulating the temperature which took a little bit away from the garden dome experience so  the AC maintenance needs some work. Because the dome is so private and enclosed, there is a bit of an echo effect any time a sound was made inside the dome including our own voices which was an odd sensation but entertaining nonetheless - as a result of the extreme privacy, it was also very quiet inside the dome if not for our own conversations (but given the echo effect I would presume a speaker playing music inside the dome would be too echo-ey). Luckily towards the last half of the meal, there was a live band in the main restaurant that played loudly enough that we could hear it softly through our dome which was fantastic as they played great covers of 90s alternative rock songs !

As we arrived for a late 830pm reservation, by the time we finished our meal the rest of the restaurant had started to close and turn off the rest of their beautiful garden and restaurant lights so unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt walk around and enjoy the rest of the facilities afterwards but walking through initially I did get a sneak peek of how spacious and beautifully decorated both floors of the restaurant was so I look forward to booking a table in other areas of the restaurant the next time I visit !

Overall, an amazing experience in an amazing city!",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Botanico+at+The+Summerhouse/@1.408043,103.8322729,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da1bb74224843d:0x3b51b1daad0a7dd8!8m2!3d1.408043!4d103.8683218!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBRENpOURRVWxSUVVOdlpFTm9kSGxqUmpsdlQyeE9jVnBJVGt0U01rMTZWMGhTYWxOclVqQlpNMXBGWWtkT2FscEZSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEFCK4BEEI!16s%2Fg%2F11ry3km8xf"
Botanico at The Summerhouse,Jeff Lo,"My fiance chose Botanico to propose our engagement, and it was an unforgettable experience!

The atmosphere was magical‚Äîset in a private dome that we had all to ourselves for over two hours, while enjoying a beautiful five-course meal. The setting was intimate and perfect for the occasion, and the service was outstanding throughout. The staff were incredibly attentive and thoughtful, especially as my fianc√© had planned a surprise for me.

A special shoutout to Prisca Ellanie, our main server, who went above and beyond. She was warm, accommodating, and made us feel truly special‚Äîsurprising us with a complimentary dessert and even helping capture photos to remember the moment.

Tucked away in the tranquil greenery of Seletar Aerospace Park, this restaurant offers a peaceful escape from the bustle of city life, making it perfect for those seeking a relaxing yet refined dining experience.

I highly recommend the signature dishes‚Äîeach plate is a beautiful balance of flavors, textures, and presentation. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of meat, seafood, or plant-based options, there‚Äôs something for every palate.

We had the Japanese Hamburg and Iberico pork collar for our mains. Followed by the taro panda cotta for dessert which left our bellies satisfied.

The service was exceptional as well. The staff was warm, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the food and drinks they were serving. They were happy to recommend pairings and offered great insights into the sourcing and preparation of the dishes.

If you're looking for a place that offers not just delicious food, but also an experience that feels both special and intimate, Botanico at The Summerhouse is the place to be. It‚Äôs perfect for a romantic dinner, a special occasion, or even a peaceful brunch with friends.

NOMADS,Daniel,"Great ambience, a caf√© with a cool outdoor camping vibe that‚Äôs Instagram worthy.

But food? Honestly, skip the truffle fries. Paid $18 expecting truffle goodness, but all I got was plain fries with zero truffle flavor. Is truffle oil really that expensive, or are they just being stingy?

Ordered the tiger prawn aglio olio for $28, and it tasted like something you‚Äôd get at Saizeriya. The only saving grace was the size of the prawn, but it wasn‚Äôt even fresh.

Also, a heads up, the high ratings here might be because they waive your drinks if you leave a Google review but only if it‚Äôs 4 stars or above. Now you know why the reviews look so good.

And about the service charge you‚Äôre paying, what exactly does it cover? Just bringing you the food, which McDonald‚Äôs does for free.

The tea were refillable which is great, however the Kaki Fry wasnt really up to our expectation on the physical aspects, probably due to the word ""jumbo"" and the menu illustration, but nonetheless it still taste great with their house tartare sauce.

We were served by an Indian lady - Ms Jagjit Kaur, she was friendly and proactive in her service, ensuring we enjoyed the dining experience in Aburi-En. Kudos to her attentiveness and hardwork :)

Minus 1 star - The cashier (Asian Chinese middle-aged lady with low ponytail) that attended to us wasn't wearing ANY MASK at all, during the whole payment process.

As for the food:
‚Ä¢	Mushroom soup: Tasty and enjoyable.

‚Ä¢	Mushroom ragout fettuccine: Supposedly their signature dish, but it didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. The sauce lacked depth, and I struggled to finish it. I also noticed another diner leaving behind a sizable portion.

‚Ä¢ Little Miner‚Äôs Spaghetti: A complete letdown for the little one. It barely had any sauce, and despite the menu stating spaghetti, it was served with rigatoni instead. The pasta could have been cooked a little longer, and ironically, the grapes on the plate were the best part of the dish. It felt like very little thought was put into this dish.

‚Ä¢	Balinese dark chocolate tart: Good flavor, but not sure why the toffee layer was so hard.

Mari Mari Seafood - Woodlands Koufu Headquarters,Pearly Ang,"Contacted Novestine via Whatsapp and he prepared the menu for us based on our budget. He was very thoughtful and i did not regret leaving the choice to him. He was honest and said that as there were only 4 of us, there would have been too much food if he gave me a big fish and so he reduced the size. We had fish maw soup with baby abalone to start and this was one of my faves. It was not starchy. Even the abalone was  yummy and tender. Their signature flying noodles was packed with flavour. Pomfret was super fresh and the scallops, smothered in garlic was awesome! Another favourite dish for me. By the time the crab came, we were so full! Still we stuffed our faces. The crab was plump with meat and sweet! Sauce was a little on the sweet side and not spicy. I would have preferred it spicier. Overall, a really finger licking good meal and Ethan was very friendly too. He made sure we saw our crab before it, erhm, made its sacrifice for our meal . Will definitely be back for more.

Note to non- smokers: sit further away from the shop and nearer to the caifan shop next time as smokers kept going to where we were seated. It was quite unpleasant to have folks smoking when we were eating. But this has nothing to do with mari mari!

Cheval Cafe Bar Bistro,MH Tham,"Cheval once sat comfortably close to my place near Kensington Square, taunting me on a frequent basis whenever friends were looking for a quiet spot for a meetup. Of course, fate has a sense of humor, and by the time I finally decided to give it a shot, it had packed its bags and moved to a far-flung corner of the island.

The new location boasts a spacious, pet-friendly alfresco area that dwarfs its indoor seating. It is a paradise for pet lovers but perhaps less so for non-pet-friendly folks.

Food-wise, imagine stepping into a time machine and landing in the pre-Michelin Singapore of the 2000s. The dishes are nostalgic in terms of taste, cooking technique and (lack of) presentation. Prices have been scaled back to pre-pandemic levels at this new location, which sounds like a win‚Äîuntil you realize the trade-offs.

Portions are dainty, marination feels like an afterthought, and frozen ingredients dominate the plates.
- Lobster Bisque: More like a bowl of orange cream, topped with a single piece of frozen lobster.
- Fish and Chips: Lightly battered to the point of being shy.
- Beef Cubes: Best of the lot, but accompanying sauce tastes too zesty.
- Seafood Paella: Takes the cake with extremely small portion, topped with frozen seafood.

It is evident the chef knows his/her craft, but when working with ingredients this underwhelming, even the best techniques can‚Äôt save the day. A real shame really, as the food has so much potential.

The cocktail, however, is the saving grace of this place. It a throwback to the good old days when cocktails were unapologetically potent and actually tasted like a cocktail instead of ‚Äúartisanal‚Äù. The whisky sour used simple sweetened cherry, lemon and orange that elevates humble bar-top whisky to greatness. The bartender deserves a standing ovation.

Service was quick, friendly, and refreshingly unobtrusive. In fact, I think one of them doubled up as the bartender. As for the ambiance, the rustic charm of horses strutting by while you dine lends the place an effortless classiness.

For pet owners, this spot is a gem compared to most pet-friendly cafes in Singapore, where ‚Äúpet-friendly‚Äù often translates to barely edible food. Cheval‚Äôs culinary shortcomings may be frustrating, but at least  you get good drinks and chill vibes.",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cheval+Cafe+Bar+Bistro/@1.4281829,103.7313835,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da124e5a0db2e1:0x1468ee3f67511326!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da124997d2ef75:0xedda72683ad8216f!8m2!3d1.4281829!4d103.7674324!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEGYmlzdHJvmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5vYjA1TFVHSm5FQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQUI1QIQNA!16s%2Fg%2F1tqchqsj"

Cheval Cafe Bar Bistro,Sally Lee,"My friends and I visited Cheval last Friday evening (4th of April) for dinner and drinks.

Food: 4/5 stars. The food was typical of what you would find in a bistro-bar. Taste wise, above average and overall good. There is nothing to complain about the food but also there is nothing super impressive or amazing. The prices are reasonable and of good value. Best dish: chicken wings

Service: 5/5 stars. The waiters are extremely attentive and polite. They remove finished dishes promptly and also top up our waters quickly.

Atmosphere: 2/5 stars. The only reason for the low score in this category is due to the awkward atmosphere of the open mic event. The hostess was awkward and lacked charm or wit, failing to attract customers to participate in her open mic event. I am still awarding 2 stars for her effort in persistently calling out to customers to ‚Äúcome try sing a song‚Äù and for her attempt in ‚Äúrara-ing‚Äù the crowd. Overall, the atmosphere could have been much better with just some light background music, or with a live band instead. I think in future I would visit during lunch time instead, apparently during lunch time there is a view of people riding horses just beside the bistro!

LiXin Teochew Fishball Noodles - Causeway Point,Oh Jun En,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
I recently tried the signature *mee pok* noodles here, and it was absolutely amazing! The noodles had the perfect  Q texture, springy and so satisfying. The soup was incredibly generous and full of flavour, a real highlight of the meal. The fishballs were chewy and bouncy, just the way they should be.

What really made the experience even better was the staff. They were super friendly, welcoming, and made sure I had everything I needed. Overall, this place is a must-visit for any noodle lover! Highly recommend!

Dian Xiao Er (Causeway Point),Glynis Ee,"Food was great ‚Äî especially the duck, which was really enjoyable. However, the service experience fell short.

The ordering system requires scanning a QR code to use an app, but the app didn‚Äôt indicate the kitchen‚Äôs last order timing. I tried to place a takeaway order around 915pm, waited for 15 minutes, only to be informed (after I asked) that the kitchen had already closed at 9pm.

There was no proactive communication from the service crew, and no last call was made to the tables. I assumed the restaurant closed at 9:30pm, as is common for many F&B places, so this was quite disappointing. The staff seemed more focused on packing up than attending to customers.

Ten spices duck: Duck is tender and the skin is fragrant n crispy. Sauce is very herby but duck doesnt soak it up well so be sure to douse it in the sauce first. Not a big duck fan, but its decent nonetheless.

Hotplate tofu: Hotplate didnt come hot unfortunately but the sauce is pretty good. Tofu is very standard.

Broccoli n scallops: Very healthy dish. The sauce is thin n light not thick. Good for elderly but for me i prefer a dish with stronger fragrance.

Dong po meat: Sauce is good, meat is a little tough but still manageable. Overall a good rendition.

CCK 253 Tasty Roti Prata,Metal Bhai,"I'm my opinion, the best prata and Dalcha curry in SG... been a loyal customer of theirs for since 2015...sadly recently, only very recently, couple of the staff (1 skinny fella and another older uncle) got unhappy when I ask for slightly more curry than what most other ppl ask for and began charging me extra 50 cents per packet on top of the free curry they think I need to eat with my prata. I'm NOT other people and the curry I ask for is a reasonable amount BECAUSE I like to mix my curry with 3 kosong prata I buy weekly and I want my prata drowned in curry.. That's HOW I eat it...i don't like having my prata and curry separate and AM very Very VERY disappointed they began charging extra per packet of curry. Nonetheless, I'M Gonna be fair and say they do have (IN MY HONEST ""EXPERT"" OPINION) the best prata and Dalcha combo IN SINGAPORE.
$1.10 PER KOSONG/PLAIN
$1.60 PER TELUR/EGG
don't bother trying other westernised versions of prata cos they're just blasphemous.

To the owner of this prata stall... Don't be stingy with your curry... I'm prolly the only one (if not in the minority) that asks for ABIT more curry than what you THINK is enough for me. I've been faithfully going to Yr shop EVERY WEEKEND to buy 4 kosong + 1 telur ( I eat 3 kosong, wife eat 1 kosong 1 egg) I think I deserve abit more respect than having someone else tell me a certain amount of curry is enough for ME OWN DINING experience.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/CCK+253+Tasty+Roti+Prata/@1.4019304,103.7148171,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da11cb411488fd:0x8b4536aaf5499612!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da11c441fa11cb:0xc386f7ad99776d2e!8m2!3d1.377479!4d103.7445107!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERaW5kaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTXpOVWxmUWkxM1JSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIQBBA!16s%2Fg%2F11f3mc0ppd"
Common Grill @ Hillion Mall,Ram,"The food was quite mediocre. The fish and chips was quite poor, doesn't taste very fresh at all with rather chewy batter and an odd taste that I can't seem to figure if it's from the fish or the spices in the batter itself. Not to mention the corn and salad are honestly there more for presentation then actual taste, considering they give one measly quarter piece of corn and chopped up mixed greens.

The burger was fine, not amazing and not really worth the price either. Taste and size of the beef patty itself was fine, but tbh you'd get more value from a McDonald's burger, so don't waste your time and money getting a burger from here. Fries were good, but there are better sides to get to be honest.

Overall the food didn't taste all that good nor fresh, potions are decent but for the tiny corn and bland salad, they may as well provide two sides instead of one and get rid of the corn and salad since its basically nothing at that point.

Observed that the sashimi/sushi staff members were busy preparing takeaway/delivery orders. Staff should have the mentality to prioritise dine in orders first, instead of only preparing takeaway/delivery orders, if they are overwhelmed and can't cope.

20 October 2024 update: The Wafu Beef Wazen was rubbish today. Gravy was way too dark and too salty.

Although there was no queue when visited on 23 July 2023, the place was already crowded. Ordering was fuss free and easy via scanning the QR code on the table. Also managed to redeem the free Aka item by informing the server. There was a normal wait for the food to arrive. Part of the total bill was offset by eCapita Voucher. Overall a good experience.

Milan Shokudo,Yi Ling,"Came here for lunch on a weekday, and it was my 1st time dining at Milan Shokudo, which I have heard the food options be similar to Saiz*riya but the Halal version! I'm quite excited to try this place when I know I can bring my Muslim friends here!

üíß Water is complimentary & and self-service.

Price range starts from $6-$13 for mains for an aglio olio, which is pretty okay-ish for price. We wanted to order the lunch set deals, but the online product listing kept switching on and off? I'm not sure if it's a bug glitch because we can't order the pasta set either, when the hot plate set was the only one off. Yet when we checked with the staff again, the hot plate was back on, but the pasta was not. A lot of the items were also out of stock during lunch hour as well. We kinda gave up figuring it out and just ordered ala carte pasta.

üç§ Basil Prawn Pasta did not look like the photos, but it was still not bad. It leans towards the cream sauce with basil style with 4 shrimps & 2 salad leaves. Portion size is small, and the handmade pasta had a texture closer to korean ramyun, which was.. interesting.
I rate: 3/5 üåü

ü¶ê Seafood Tom Yum Pasta was pretty okay as well. Sauce has a prominent sour tang of a tom Yum Soup, as ingredients consisted of shrimps, clams, and scallops. Pasta like the above was chewy and wavy like korean ramyun.

Milan Shokudo,Shanice Teo,"The food was alright especially if you are looking for something cheap but good. The only problem I had was the staffs there, particularly the staff that has blue hair.

What I don‚Äôt understand is why does she have to reply to us like that as if we pissed her off when we weren‚Äôt even shouting or yelling at her? From there we lost our appetite. To add on, she was talking very loudly and rudely to her coworkers on how tired she is to ‚Äòentertain‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt know what that means but okay. And then she was yelling loudly again that she is tired and pissed and while saying that, she threw the menu. Maybe she had a bad day or that she faced too many customers that pissed her off, I understand that. But that doesn‚Äôt mean she got to shout and yell emphasising shes tired to entertain people. If she is tired then simply quit the job as an fnb staff and find another job, is that easy.

Bollywood Farms Pte Ltd,J H,"I brought my dog (a lab retriever) and my family down to Bollywood Farms on a Sunday and we had such a great time there!
Here are what we enjoyed:
1. My dog (while leashed of course) and us were allowed to explore the farm freely. My dog really enjoyed the walk as there were so many scents from the herbs :) Just note that you will be seated outdoors at the restaurant if you have a dog.
2. The space and variety. The farm is really huge with such a huge variety of plants. There was even a large fish pond in the middle. Parking is readily available too.
3. The interesting decorations and quirky quotes around the farm.
4. The food. Food was amazing and rather reasonably priced considering the concept of the place. As it was Hari Raya weekend, we paid $15++ for a set which came with a cold drink, nasi campur and cendol. Try ordering the banana bread if available. While it costs $4 per slice, its moist, fluffy, and packed with flavour.
5. The staff. The staff were really helpful and friendly. They welcomed my dog and other doggos too. I brought a wagon for my dog to sit on while other dogs had their own chairsüòÇ really cute!

Things to take note of:
1. There may be monitor lizards around given that we live in Singapore and the place is surrounded by greenery. We spotted 2 while we were there but they were just minding their own business.
2. For outdoor seatings, it can get really hot despite there being standing fans so be sure to bring water for your pets if you are planning to bring them.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bollywood+Farms+Pte+Ltd/@1.4184872,103.6804679,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0ded9c12ea4d:0x887b774418b705e3!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0ded844c93d3:0x2f6b01755e7c1628!8m2!3d1.4184872!4d103.7165168!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEGYmlzdHJvmgEgQ2hSRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWTUxXMXpjaTB6YVhKSmJCQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIPxA7!16s%2Fm%2F05b5c91"

The students were very eager to please, closely supervised and attentive.
Our party of 4 ordered different mains and desserts so that we can see and try different dishes. The only disappointing dish is the seafood laksa pao fan which my friend felt it was underwhelming with too little ingredients and uninteresting plating. Other than that, the bread was delicious, appetiser of rojak was light and fresh, oxtail soup is the clear soup type, not creamy but tasty. The catch of the day, seabass was good, so was the beef cheeks. Special mention for chicken tikka which was flavourful and surprisingly tender despite the breast meat.

Amber West,Chloe Teo,"5 stars for the student‚Äôs effort, and a very encouraging petite Chinese female teacher of theirs. She would push the students to perform better, but in an encouraging manner.

Food wise... felt that the pork chop could do with a new supplier. Sent photos to a few friends who though it‚Äôs chicken breast. Nothing to do with the cooking, the original meat itself seems to be too dry and tough. White sliced mantou wasn‚Äôt filling as a carb, especially since they took the free bread & butter away and replaced it with a really really salty and oily cracker.

The mocktail could have an option to be less sweet as well. Could also possibly tone down the sugar level on the desserts too.

The seafood dish was great though. Fresh and succulent, worth the price. It‚Äôs not spicy unlike the menu says (which is great). Starters are nice.

Ichiban Boshi (JEM),Joel Ng,"Extremely disappointed. The prices are not equal to the quality of food, service, or atmosphere.

Food quality:
Food quality is average, around same taste as the Japanese food in food courts.

Alternatives:
For Japanese food and sashimi, try bento and sushi sets from Fairprice or Donki. If you are in the mood for tonkatsu, consider Tonkatsu by Ma Maison @ Westgate that offers unlimited rice(brown and white), soup and finely sliced raw vegetable salad with unlimited condiments (sauces for the salad). Compare that to ichiban which charges 3 sgd for a small bowl of white rice.

Service:
The poor staff are squeezed to the brim by the upper management in pursuit of greater profits for RE&S group. Understaffed, and even the manager is helping out with chores around the restaurant. Had to attract the attention of staff to even get basic service, otherwise it is basically the same as self service at the food courts.

Alternatives:
If you are looking for attentive service, consider din tai fung. Din tai Fung staff are busy but they hire way more people and their staff are much better trained. Whenever they see your tea cup empty, they will approach your table and offer to refill it, even if you are sitting at a corner. Staff is extremely attentive and friendly and despite the recent increase in prices, they have maintained their excellent service. Compare that to ichiban where you have to attract the attention of the staff to receive even basic service, it is literally food court with restaurant pricing at ichiban.

Atmosphere:
Reasonably nice decor and general clanking of dishes is to be expected of restaurants around this price range.

Alternatives:
Any restaurant. Din tai Fung has nicer decor, Xiang Xiang has free flow ice cream and snacks.

I will be avoiding all restaurants under RE&S due to their exploitative business practices of seeking profit at the expense of the consumer and workers.

Salmaan Food Paradise,Michael McNamara,"Salmaan Food Paradise, is a sole proprietorship made up of a food and drink stall, and nothing much else. It is located in the middle of a row of shops, on the ground floor of Block 338, Jurong East Avenue 1.

This 4-storey HDB apartment block sits some 80 metres back from the main road, a couple of blocks from the Jurong Polyclinic. A small carpark that can accommodate about 20 small-capacity vehicles spreads between 337 and 338. An incline makes 338 accessible to the wheelchair-bound. However, a short step is necessary to get into the Food Paradise proper.

Except for the prestigious moniker, Salmaan's is, in a general sense, a coffee shop. Nevertheless, it has managed to attract a small niche of customers from the nearby Jurong Polyclinic, and surrounding neighbourhoods, who would need to commute to get there.

Salmaan's specialises in Indian cuisine. For breakfast, it offers the locally popular Roti Prata, the plain and egg versions. It also stocks some Malay kuehs, such as the epok-epok, kueh lapis, gendang kasturi, and karipap, presumably supplied by private entrepreneurs.

Lunch is the standard fare of Nasi Briyani, with the common but complete choice of condiments. Beef and chicken are the basic compliments, prepared in hot, spicy paste, that goes well with the cooler taste buds.

Salmaan's also has a spread of dishes for those who prefer white rice instead of the Basmati. Mutton, chicken, fish, and seafood, such as, prawns and squids, come in fried and gravy-drowned options. Vegetables, such as boiled okra, egg-plants, spinach, and cabbage, that look somewhat similar to some Malay fares, are also generally immersed in varieties of soup and gravy, that are rich in coconut milk, curry, and a mix of choice spices, turning simple ingredients into creamy and yummy meals that are sure to linger on the senses, post-lunch.

While the food may be described as 'amazing', for such a small establishment, the beverages are, on the whole, common and unimpressive. Local hot delights - the ubiquitous tea and coffee, both plain and with milk added versions - are the most popularly asked for drinks, other than the canned sodas. Those looking for unique concoctions will do better elsewhere.

Although the foods served are categorically exceptional, customers remain loyal mainly due to the friendly service and humble prices. While most coffee shops have adopted the self-service practice, Salmaan's still waits and delivers. It also allows bills to be paid at the end of meals, instead of the pay-and-eat style most others are adopting.

In short, Salmaan Food Paradise offers convenience, variety and respect, that customers fancy and cherish.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Salmaan+Food+Paradise/@1.3452268,103.6952284,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1020d1a13d83:0x2ffca27cf81235a4!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1020d174bbf1:0x6a9c33fc41d25710!8m2!3d1.3502561!4d103.7312915!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERaW5kaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUXRjVWwyWW5GQlJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABA1!16s%2Fg%2F11f12662pd"

Kebabs Faktory (West Mall),ML,"It‚Äôs just a kiosk outside West Mall beside the subway sandwich. Decided to try this as it‚Äôs something new to me other than the usual fast food.
They were having a $9.90 promotion set. I ordered the chicken wrap. It was filled with veggies and a scoop of grilled chicken. The food was well seasoned and fries was still warm. It‚Äôs a bit on the salty side for me so luckily I had a drink.
Service was fast and staff patient & friendly enough despite the hot working environment and noisy atmosphere due to on-going construction. I got my order in less than 10 min with order and prep time. The food was made to order.
Don‚Äôt mind eating this again next time if I want a quick takeaway meal.

No choice but to downgrade this review because of inconsistent service received that doesn‚Äôt make customer have the confidence to return. Just makes mood feels lousy to buy from there.

Takagi Ramen @ Woodlands,„Ç®„ÉûTAN,"I have been a regular customer of this specific outlet for years, I mainly order from grabfood then I‚Äôd occasionally order takeaway physically at the place. It seemed like today was crowded and there were only visibly 2 staff doing the work. Ordered from the kiosk and waited outside. But the number flashing thing outside has been broken for a while so I had no choice but to wait inside where it was cramped because the entrance had people queuing up to use the kiosk and staff coming in and out and others coming in and leaving. When I went inside, the number flashing basically skipped my number/ showed the numbers before and after my number so I thought maybe it‚Äôs not in chronological order and continued waiting. Then I saw them bring out a bag of noodles and drink which looked like my order but I couldn‚Äôt be sure. Checked the bag for a receipt with the order number but there was nothing. Then continued waiting and saw the numbers be flashed in chronological order so I realised they must have skipped my order and also not have indicated the order number on the physical food. I checked with the staff and he rudely responded to me confirming that the takeaway order is mine and he gave me the impression like I was wasting his time or I missed the timing for my order when in reality my order was not called and there was no receipt attached to the food order to indicate anything. I came home and found out my order was missing an egg which was an add on I paid extra for.

Other times when I ordered from the place physically, there was once where I ordered takeaway as usual and while I received my order receipt with the number, I went outside to wait and waited for more than 40 min and realised my order number was not flashed on the screen at all. Inside looked like it had only a few customers so I was confused. The staff saw me waiting outside the whole time but ignored me. They were generally free and not doing anything so I thought it was weird and finally went in to check. Turns out for some reason the kiosk machine had some issues sending over the order to the staff so they never received the order and I waited for nothing and had to order verbally at the cashier.

I do enjoy specific foods from this place but I hope improvements can be made on the things I mentioned above :‚Äô) maybe it‚Äôs also my fault for not clarifying earlier but even when I did try to clarify I was met with a dismissive and aggressive response. In general there were multiple times I‚Äôve had not the most pleasant experiences when ordering from the place physically.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Takagi+Ramen+@+Woodlands/@1.4344838,103.7434359,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da13f13e355b2f:0x41cc6977856e7a69!8m2!3d1.434909!4d103.7860866!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgETamFwYW5lc2VfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuVFVObk9YSmhka0pSRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQPg!16s%2Fg%2F11mw70prwt"

Specifically for Mandai though, especially weekends, do expect to queue from 6pm onwards (due to people exiting the Mandai attractions).

Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin),Alden Ng,"A great place for a quick dim sum bite at a really affordable price. The variety available here is impressive, with many selections to choose from ranging from the usual classics like siew mai, har gow, char siew bao, and chee cheong fun, to other tasty small plates that make it easy to order a spread for sharing. Every dish I tried was tasty and freshly prepared, with quality comparable to what you would expect at other dim sum shops. Portion sizes are also reasonable and consistent with typical dim sum standards, so you can order a good mix without feeling that the servings are too small.

What makes this spot even better is that it‚Äôs housed within a coffee shop that also offers plenty of other food choices. This makes it very convenient if you are visiting with friends or family who might prefer different dishes beyond dim sum. You can easily mix and match, sharing plates from the dim sum stall alongside noodles, rice, or other hawker favourites available within the same space. It really adds to the overall dining experience and makes it suitable for groups of all ages.

The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, perfect for a fuss-free meal. Service is quick, and food is served hot, so it‚Äôs ideal if you‚Äôre in the area and just want a satisfying meal without waiting too long. Parking is also not an issue here‚Äîthe carpark is located just beside the coffee shop with plenty of available lots. The rates are affordable compared to other busy areas, which makes it even more convenient for those driving.

Overall, this is a reliable and budget-friendly choice for dim sum lovers looking for good variety, value for money, and easy accessibility.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dim+Sum+Express+(Kuai+Can+Dian+Xin)/@1.4425116,103.7625297,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da16e6b8e20cbd:0xf066cfb5fe5fbcac!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da13a5fd4ebbdd:0x806dd9d94bcc3d8!8m2!3d1.4357569!4d103.8054455!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESZGltX3N1bV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVE1TVRVeVduWlJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECHIQIw!16s%2Fg%2F11h6qkfrhp"
Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin),oXRYSTALo Ong,"Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin): A Late-Night Dim Sum Haven with Budget-Friendly Bites

Alright, folks, listen up! My friends and I were craving a late-night dim sum fix after an our bike ride, and we stumbled upon Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin). This place was tucked away in a quiet corner, a little off the beaten path, but it was open 24 hours, which was perfect for our late-night cravings.

The Good:

‚Ä¢ The Price: The dim sum was incredibly affordable. They had a deal where you could get a free basket of dim sum for every 10 baskets you bought, making it incredibly budget-friendly.  That was a huge plus, especially when compared to other dim sum places where a similar amount could easily cost you double or even triple the price.

‚Ä¢ The Convenience: It was the perfect spot for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly. It was open 24 hours, which was a major plus for us!  It was the perfect place to satisfy a late-night craving. Plus, there was a large car park nearby, making parking a breeze.

The Quirks:

‚Ä¢ The Food: The dim sum menu had a lot of variety, but honestly, the taste was just average. The har gow and siu mai, classic dim sum dishes, didn't really wow us.

‚Ä¢ The Coffee Shop: The drink stall next to the dim sum stall only accepted cash, so keep that in mind.

My Friend‚Äôs Note: I love that it‚Äôs open 24 hours! It‚Äôs great to have a place I can go to for dim sum whenever I want!

My Note: The price is great, but I think the food could be better.

Rating:

‚Ä¢ Food: 3/5 (Just okay, not the best dim sum)

‚Ä¢ Service: 3.5/5 (Acceptable)

‚Ä¢ Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (Okay ambience)

Overall: 3/5

Overall: The ambience was decent, and the service was fine, but it was the affordability and the 24-hour availability that really stood out. It‚Äôs a good option for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly.  I'd say if you're in the area, it's worth popping in to give it a try, but if you're a serious dim sum connoisseur, you might want to check out other options.  But for the price, it‚Äôs a decent choice.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dim+Sum+Express+(Kuai+Can+Dian+Xin)/@1.4425116,103.7625297,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da16e6b8e20cbd:0xf066cfb5fe5fbcac!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da13a5fd4ebbdd:0x806dd9d94bcc3d8!8m2!3d1.4357569!4d103.8054455!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESZGltX3N1bV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVE1TVRVeVduWlJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECHIQIw!16s%2Fg%2F11h6qkfrhp"

The Happy Cafe,iReview . One million views / month,"Weeknight exploration brought me to a far far away land. So might as well have dinner.

The restaurant was empty and it appears to be accidental; after thought; make shift rather than a real restaurant-restaurant.

There was not service interaction. Scan to order - pick up when number is called - return your own tray. Very efficient and robotic.

For 11 bucks I say it‚Äôs a good deal.
But food is rather meh and mid.
It‚Äôs felt like it‚Äôs assembled from various suppliers - nothing‚Äôs prepared.

The fish was fried fish loh.
Basic batter and fillet. Not fresh and not overly crispy.

The salad was ready made coleslaw. Industrial standard.

It‚Äôs functional eating.

Captain Kim Korean BBQ & Hotpot Buffet,Jitya M.Topaz,"I had a fantastic time at this place. I'm usually not a big fan of Korean dishes, but this halal barbecue spot exceeded my expectations. Even without pork, the chicken, fish, and beef dishes were amazing. The marination was especially good, and I particularly enjoyed the black pepper chicken.
The staff were very attentive, constantly refilling the hotpot soup. My only complaint is that the drinks were not very flavorful; they were a bit watery. They should definitely work on improving the drinks. Other than that, everything was perfect, and I plan to come back with friends and family. The discount coupon for returning customers is also a great incentive.

A-One Signature West Mall,Will,"Service is great and food is served pipping hot. Not too salty. Disposable tissue and appetisers are optional, if u take, it is payable.

Despite being a single dinner, I was offered space and sufficient service that I felt comfortable with. The Yi Ping Guo is very good. There's fish maw, prawns, scallops, fish and broccoli. Plain porridge comes with a cost still as it has scallops and fried ikan. I had a hearty meal, to the extent of almost can't finish.

Deco of this restaurant is classic and aircon is cool enough for a hot day. Tables and chairs are well spaced and clean. But the back resting board is shaky. Pls mend it before it traps pest or fall onto customers.

Internally sometimes the staff speaks way too loudly. It is a restaurant, so Shd still have some quiet ambience. Can talk, but in the kitchen in a milder manner. Can even hear them when they are in the kitchen. Sometimes they Shd talked v loudly in the dinning area too.

Walked a big round to find Aone. It is not inside the mall but at the outside facing the road.

Hunt for the outside of Yakun and pastamania, then walked along, towards pastiamania and after a shortest u will find it.

Fusion Spoon,Yvonne Tan,"(Updated review)
Fusion spoon underwent renovation and overhaul recently (new operator?). Food prices have increased across the board, some popular items were no longer on the menu.

Quality is disappointing. I ordered the curry chicken rice set ($10.90?). Only one side of one piece of chicken was burnt (black) - looks like it was perhaps at the bottom of the pan and reheated? The curry also had a slightly sour ish smell, taste wasn‚Äôt sour but wasn‚Äôt fantastic either.

We also ordered the nasi lemak burger ($18.90). For $18.90, the amount of fries was really stingy. I took a fries and my hub squeezed the chili sauce on the side when the staff came over to say they made a mistake (no further explanation), and proceeded to quickly collect the plate of burger‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ I explained to her we already touched it, but i guess she was really rushing cos she didn‚Äôt respond to me. I hope they didn‚Äôt give the burger to other customers. After about 5 min, our order was called again to collect the correct burger.

(Review in 2020)
Giving it 5-star because the place is beautiful, clean, has nice view, great variety of food and is value-for-money.

If you‚Äôre specially making a trip here for the food, you might be disappointed. I would think most patrons are park-goers looking to fill their stomach. My family enjoys coming here. Sometimes, we walk to the park, enjoy the scenery and fresh air, have our meal and walk back home.

My family‚Äôs favourite is their nyonya laksa ($6.90?), mee siam, nasi lemak and Hawaiian pizza ($7.90?) for the kids. I find their portion rather generous.

The restaurant might get really crowded on weekend dinner time and during events held at Jurong Lake Gardens.

The menu is available at the counter, on the TV and outside the door. After placing an order, you‚Äôll have to keep a look out for your number to collect your food (may involve multiple trips). The prices are pretty much fast-food restaurant prices, hence self-service is expected.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fusion+Spoon/@1.3408186,103.6890865,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0f1ca6625465:0xb2f295af99d96fea!8m2!3d1.3408186!4d103.7251354!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VNeWQwdzNOSFJCUlJBQqoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBQjIAxA2!16s%2Fg%2F11h70qg5sj"

Ambience was nice, cool and tables were spaced apart from each other comfortably. The place was fairly full but service was steady and calm.

Good
- short wait for the food.
- clear and audible order call number system. Lots of call number screens around the restaurant.
- must try beef rendang, vegetarian Yee fu noodles, and the hot traditional milk tea

Can improve
- vegetarian Yee fu noodles for $9.40 should include an egg. You can refer to the pic.

PastaMania ‚Äì Italian Casual Dining @ West Mall,ML,"Tried the newly revamped pasta mania at west mall. The renovation is good, the space is clean & bright, also no stale smell now. Previously I didn‚Äôt like to go there because there‚Äôs a strong stale cheese smell. But now there‚Äôs no smell.

The seating is spacious indoor and outdoor. But outside you can smell the exhaust. Not so ideal.

The pasta or flavors are local / Asian style not like authentic Italian so if you‚Äôre a stickler for traditional Italian food then this is not the place for you.
If you want fast casual dining western style kinda Italian food, at a reasonable price, this is not bad. There‚Äôs no additional GST or service charge.
Many selections of pastas, pizza and appetizers. You can easily get a good meal for less than $20/ person.

I had the promotional set, it was good - Mentaiko cream scallop pasta, seafood tomato soup &
Garlic bread with a drink. I felt the drink was a bit too sweet and soup & garlic bread was a bit on the salty side but it‚Äôs pretty good value at $19.90. Pasta was nice and creamy. I felt the flavor was just right.

Service was prompt enough. Food was piping hot and the staff were friendly & polite.

Yogiyo Korean restaurant,Karen Liu,"We visited this restaurant in Beauty World for dinner largely due to the high reviews on Google. Compared to the other Korean restaurants in the same building, I do agree that this one is the best. However, compared to other Korean restaurants in Tanjong Pagar, etc, this restaurant was just meh.

We made a reservation through Instagram. I suggest you reserve a table before going because there seemed to be a line growing outside the shop around 7 pm.

It is self service - you order through a QR code. Staff were distant but not rude.

I believe the ban chan was free flow - but it was not topped up though. Quite meh and unremarkable. The omelette was dry. The kimchi was lukewarm and was rather bland. The marinated fishcakes, cucumbers and potato was nothing to shout about. But it‚Äôs complimentary so can‚Äôt really complain.

I ordered the nangmyeon ($15++). The cold noodles was refreshing, though it is a very carb-heavy main. It was only topped with a quarter of a hard boiled egg and less than 10 slices (or should I say slivers) of pear, as well as shredded cucumber. It was pleasantly acidic and cold but it does get boring after a while. You may want to order another side along with this - perhaps the bongsam or mandu.

My partner got the pork soup which tasted much better and had a generous amount of pork slices. It tastes rich but the MSG was apparent.

Yogiyo Korean restaurant,Harry Choi,"I had such a good experience in the restaurant. The owner is so welcoming and it‚Äôs always bright all the time in the restaurant. I really like the vibe in the restaurant. It‚Äôs so cool that I get to hear Korean every time. It feels like I‚Äôm becoming Korean. Anyways, the food is really good of course. And I really enjoyed the food so much by eating them with my friends. U recommend the Korean stone pot bibimbap which is like a traditional food in Korea in which you stir and mix healthy ingredients in the rice and eat it with mixed Korean chilli sauce. It‚Äôs just so good that I want to visit there every day. The most important thing is that they give you basically a free and infinite refill of side dishes which has better quality than most the main foods from other restaurants. So I really recommend you to say hello and thank you in Korean. She will love it. And also ask her about her second restaurant and she will tell you how good the food is in her second restaurant. So you can go there too later.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòáüòáüòáüòáüòçüòçüòçü•∞ü•∞üòòüòò",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yogiyo+Korean+restaurant/@1.3697086,103.7305602,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da195defffec57:0x60bc7b2719a9d2a!8m2!3d1.3424106!4d103.7764256!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VSMU0yWmxVVlZCRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECCkQRg!16s%2Fg%2F11r6mrr6_9"

The jjajangmyeon is top-tier, but I was also really impressed with the jjampong and the side dishes, which have improved a lot since I last visited years ago. Now they even serve egg omelette and tteokbokki on the side‚Äîwhat a surprise!

Also wanted to give a shoutout to the super friendly Indian female staff‚Äîgreat energy and service. Actually, all the staff here are lovely.

Side dishes were really bad: the sausages in the ketchup-like sauce were terribly sweet, cold pasta was also too sweet, they even had one dish that was the chinese sichuan preserved vegetable which was really strange and out of place for a korean restaurant...  As for the KBBQ  the meat was too tough and thick.

The steamed egg was also a big letdown compared to the one I had previously. Jjampong was probably the only dish that was alright. Not great, but at least it wasn't terrible. I did like the texture of their noodles, it was pretty unique.

Their business was not bad on a weekday afternoon, but seats were still available, so there's no need to come early or late to avoid a crowd.

Seoul Brother(Beauty World),Wei Tan,"Had dinner here with my family and it was the first time I hear everyone praising the food - literally no one had anything bad to say! üòÅ Everyone loved the fried chicken (my SIL said it was the best fried chicken she's ever had, and given that her mom is a darn good cook I think that's very high praise indeed; even my own mother who's really picky about food said it was her fav dish in this meal). All of us loved the army stew, especially my dad - he had 3 helpings! (almost got a 4th but he backed out reluctantly at the last minute; as far as I can recall he had never been so enthusiastic about food üòÇ); also worth mentioning was the commendable service from the wait staff who promptly refilled the soup in our stew every time we requested it (3-4 times in total, I think). For my wife and I, we favoured the Ziggle Chicken, mainly because of the deliciously chewy tteokbokki which had a lovely crispy exterior; the chicken counterpart was nice and tender too, coated amply with a tasty sweet soy sauce, but sadly it was overshadowed by the fried chicken. üòã Last but not least, there was the seafood pancake and it was also a gem - see photo to believe.

Three Meals A Day,Jun Jie Yam,"Great place for delicious Korean food!

We came on a Saturday for dinner. It was very crowded when we reached at 6pm, so reservations are highly recommended.

We tried many things from the menu:
- Mulnaengmyeon (cold noodles) were decent.
- Fried Chicken and Chicken Gangjung (fried chicken in sweet & spicy sauce) were really good! Highly recommend.
- Samgyetang (chicken soup with ginseng) was so-so. The soup's was a little bland.
- Gimbap was good.
- Dolsot Bibimbap was really good too! The sauce mixed with the rice, vegetables and meat made a very flavourful combination. Do note it may be quite spicy.
- Haemulpajeon (pancake with seafood & vegetables) was excellent! The pancake was crispy and the taste was very fragrant. The sauce also complements the pancake very well.
The side dishes are also free flow!

Service was decent. Before we got our orders, one of the staff brought us refills of the side dishes without us requesting, but towards the end of the meal, we had to ask the staff 2 times for a refill of the kimchi.

Sanook Kitchen - Lot One,Ken Peh,"Food: Orders were served promptly within 5 minutes. Staff was quick to usher us to the table, despite a visible crowd in the restaurant. Orders were through a QR code which can be scanned from the table. Prices are fairly affordable. Their Kai Lan and Sweet & Sour fish are really good.

Service: Used utensils and cutlery were picked up by the staff very quickly. Dishes were served in a very prompt manner.  For families, there are free popcorn which is self served. Good value added services, but hygiene is an issue as you might not know if the previous diners' hands are clean or not.

Atmosphere: Okay, comfortable sitting arrangements and spaces between each table fairly wide.

Overall a good 4 star rating given by me. Sanook Kitchen is just like your Thai food McDonald's style.

We had the truffle fries starters and fries were really crispy and tasted really nice.

The most surprising factor is the price of food. It is so well priced & you‚Äôll never find such good Italian food at these prices.

Swagat Indian Vegetarian,Aman Kozha,"Swagat Indian Vegetarian just performed the culinary equivalent of a Jedi mind-trick on my taste buds. One chapati thali in, and I‚Äôm already drafting a heartfelt apology letter to every chicken wing I‚Äôve ever met. The fluffy-yet-toasty chapati is a warm hug from a carb-loving fairy, and the spread of curries, veggies, rasam, and papadum turns the humble metal tray into a full-blown flavour amusement park‚Äîno roller-coaster lines, just pure spice joy.

Highlights:
‚Ä¢ The dal? So comforting, it practically asked about my day.
‚Ä¢ The veggie korma? If velvet had a taste, this would be it.
‚Ä¢ The rasam? Imagine tomato soup got a PhD in sass and decided to party.

I left 100 % satisfied, 90 % convinced I could live happily ever after on plants alone, and 10 % wondering if chapati-scented cologne is a thing.

Swagat Indian Vegetarian,Lalitha Saravanan,"To the owner,

According to Google, your shop's listed opening hours are 7:30 AM. However, when we arrived at 8:00 AM, the shop was not open, and we had to call the staff out of the kitchen. Unlike other stalls, your shop was not ready for business, and unfortunately, the staff informed us that they were not prepared to take breakfast orders.

In a location where office employees and other customers frequently visit, it's disappointing to see such a lack of readiness. I wanted to bring this to your attention, as it may be affecting your business. If necessary, please consider adjusting the opening hours to a later time when your shop is fully prepared to serve customers, especially since other stalls would already be in full operation by then.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Swagat+Indian+Vegetarian/@1.3318411,103.7091923,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da19a6cb9cee05:0xf6312cd340817ac6!8m2!3d1.3318411!4d103.7452412!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERaW5kaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUTJiR0Z5ZWxSQkVBRaoBURABKg8iC3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzKAAyHhABIhqyg6SG6UkVbWUOjdQ9cHAMsS9xMdEXayz62zIcEAIiGHJlc3RhdXJhbnRzIGluIHNpbmdhcG9yZeABAPoBBAgAECs!16s%2Fg%2F11g6yk537f"

Haq-Insaf's Eating House,M Ranjitha (Raemelis),"No longer vegetarian friendly. Insisted on asking me to pay for dhal to dip my prata, but its free if i wanted fish/chicken curry. Ordered vegetarian fried rice, was soggy and VERY salty, inedible. Used to be my favourite place, not sure why they made such rules, im sure dhal costs the same or less than meat options.

Update: just realised they responded by calling me a liar. Not only did they change to make it chargeable(ive been there before, countless times and dhal was free). They are now lying, idk why. And ignored my feedback about the poor food quality. Calling me absurd for asking why fish/chicken curry is free yet dhal is charged? Either way they didnt answer at all yet attacked back at a customer.

Fyi, when i head to other prata places, dhal is free. Your problem is changing it to chargeable without informing, and the poor quality of food. When i say dhal, i mean dhal, not sambar.

Legendary Hong Kong Restaurant @ Jurong Point È¶ôÊ∏ØÂÇ≥Â•áÈ§êÂª≥,Harriet L. Dineen,"Been going to this restaurant since 2018 and had always enjoyed the food. The last visit, however, was an extremely unpleasant experience thanks to one incredibly rude staff (circled in photo). I went to get the chili and green onion at the counter, she approached me and said I didn't wear mask so it's unfair to others -( this is December 2024 and we no longer have the mask mandate). It's still okay as I understand that since I didn't wear mask, I shouldn't get the condiment by myself and asked the staff to get chili and onion for me. The same old lady staff came over and talked to me in an accusing tone saying that I already took a lot of the onions, while in fact I only took a tiny spoon on top of some chili. She then said that if I wanted to take the onion I had to pay 3$. The way she talked down to me is not only rude but also disrespectful since I am a paying customer and if there was a need to pay 3$ I had no problem paying it, but there was in fact no need as confirmed by her manager and coworkers. I don't understand how can someone work in F&B and have this kind of demeaning attitude towards customers, talking to down to customers as if they owed her something. Hope management takes this into review.

McDonald's JEM,Oby Sumampouw,"Took 25 mins just to make an order. To be clear I had only small issue with the lateness. Because I saw there was some operational issue, it seems theyre confused on which table to deliver some orders to other patrons. I saw the backlog of orders processing keep increasing on the screen. I opted for picking up my dine in item that i think will help relieve the issue.

What is dissapointing is my number was called on the screen, but my order was not ready, I saw my tray was sitting there for 10 mins because they are waiting for my coffee. I was awkwardly standing out in front of collection because my number is called on the screen, when I looked at the screen again, my number was gone as if my order is considered ""done"". But my incomplete tray is still sitting there. I dont know if there is KPI for order speed, but thats not right. Dont turn off my order if its not done yet.

Also what is disappointing is the lack of apology for making me wait so long by the staff.

IKEA Jurong Restaurant,Xeraph Xeon,"Update: add a video of Ikea Soya Ice cream $0.50 to contribute

Eaten here since opening of this IKEA in JEM

Overall I decided to give my rating a average experience

Food(3 star):average
Food Is always warm, since it's not freshly cook anyway but you get your food faster than Mcdonald although sometime take time to get new fried chicken and mushroom soup

Service(3 star):average
Can be better, sometime fried chicken and mushroom soup isn't ready, when taking sauce from chilli and tomato section

Turn out both sauces are tomato, there isn't any chilli sauce which is unacceptable...

Atmosphere(2 star):dislike it
Very noisy and crowded although the queue isn't worse compare to Alexandra, don't like there a slope near cashier which is dangerous incase the cart hit someone on the coffee, drinks, sugar and utensils section...place isn't clean may due to bad diners leaving a mess, if you would like to get free refill coffee and stay to work here
Perharp think twice and consider going to Mcdonald Jem instead or Jurong Regional Library

Yan Palace Restaurant (Warren Golf & Country Club),Wei Jie Ng,"MANAGER ERRONEOUSLY CHARGED $3,300 FOR A $330 BILL AND DID NOT APOLOGISE.

268++ for 4 pax CNY dinner.

Service was extremely slow - waitress asked if they could serve the next dishes but each time we said ok it still took close to 20-25 minutes for the dish to be served.

The food is honestly subpar as well. Didn‚Äôt have much flavour. The yusheng was an all carrot one, surprising for a full fledged Chinese restaurant. Compare this with TungLok and the others, it‚Äôs honestly pathetic.

Fish maw soup lacked flavour. Honestly felt more like gooey mess than something that have been broiled for a long while. The cod fish was bland as well, and the texture seemed as tho it wasn‚Äôt fresh. Scallop and broccoli was a slight improvement, albeit broccoli was undercooked.

The ee-mian, a dish that everyone avoids since it‚Äôs not supposed to be the star of any meal, was perhaps the best performer in a lacklustre dinner. But that‚Äôs also because at least the green chili gave an added dimension.

Finally, dessert which was a red bean pancake. Funny thing that we asked if it could be changed to yam paste Orh nee at the start which she said no, and if we wanted we needed to top up some $20. But Orh Nee is $6 per bowl and I‚Äôm in a family of 4. Makes absolutely no sense.

To top it off they seated us in a weird square table in between large round 10 seater tables, meaning to say we were the only square table and were just in an awkward position for the entire dinner.

Long story short, absolute nightmare.

Came as a kid, thought of it as a pretty decent place. Now it‚Äôs just garbage.

Edit: it was not a pancake. It was red bean soup. And we waited 15 mins for this too.

Edit2: the manager had a ridiculous attitude also. She erroneously clicked $3,300 for a $330 meal and charged the card without realising that she added an additional 0. When we disputed she just casually remarked ‚Äúoh lucky you realised‚Äù without apologising whatsoever.

We came with 9 pax and were told to squeeze into one table, which made no sense, so we requested 2 tables ‚Äî 4 and 5 pax. The cashier auntie already seemed unhappy about having to set up another mookata pot and gave us a really bad attitude. Later when we asked (politely) about the free ice cream promotion ‚Äî which we know is usually available with a minimum spend ‚Äî she completely ignored us, black face, and acted like she didn‚Äôt hear. Honestly, if it‚Äôs not available anymore, just say so. No need for that kind of attitude. We‚Äôre paying customers, not asking for a favour.

To top it off, another staff member who lights the pots decided to clear our table without a word ‚Äî just told the cleaner to remove our bowls and utensils and let another group sit down, without even informing us first. That‚Äôs not how you treat customers.

Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,ra,"Been patronising this mookata since my secondary school days a few years ago. The attitude of the auntie, probably the lady boss, has been getting worse with every visit. Like many of the reviews I read about this place, the auntie has a very stuck up and rude attitude towards customers. The only redeeming quality is the uncle roaming around and actively topping up our soup broth promptly while remaining friendly.
Was heading over to the counter to make payment and I saw they offered free ice cream with every $20 spent. The 2 of us spent $50 at this mookata place and we just wanted to take ONE ice cream so we asked the auntie about it. she completely ignored us and glared over at us and rolled her eyes just as we were tapping our card for payment. I thought that she missed what I said so i asking again nicely. Again, she just glared at me and ignored me. After a few seconds, she then shouted at us in chinese that ‚Äúthe chocolate flavour was sold out‚Äù. I was taken aback by her suddenly shouting at me for no apparent reason?? We just walked away and proceeded to a nearby ice cream shop instead of taking her ice cream. Acting as if we are taking her stuff without purchasing anything; ridiculous.
Additionally, the portions at this place were so miserable for the price point. Meat was so thinly sliced and drenched in murky water whilst the cheese tofu had a weird taste to it. The chairs were also extremely greasy. Whilst I know that isn‚Äôt the fault of the mookata shop, it added on to the very unpleasant experience i had here.
Would not be patronising this mookata outlet again as the auntie‚Äôs attitudes is driving me away time after time again!",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Siam+Square+Mookata+-+Best+Mookata+Restaurant+in+Singapore/@1.3619464,103.7093647,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da103c558023f9:0xd6d6fdca2f172827!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da103daf99f6b9:0x1eb211db888a208e!8m2!3d1.348023!4d103.743534!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEPdGhhaV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU5YTkV4aFJXUjNFQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQUIgwQQOw!16s%2Fg%2F11c1nf9_pf"
Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,Joan Chua,"Location is a little hard to find cause it's away from the MRT thought this place would be quite packed at night, so I wanted to do a reservation, but for this particular outlet, they don't accept reservations, only walk in. I went there on a Saturday around the evening time like 9 pm, and there wasn‚Äôt much crowd. The staff quickly found a seat and sat my friend and me. It was really fast. The staff also assist in heating the pan and pouring the soup. The ordering process was seamless, haha, cause self order! The staff gave us a QR Code and asked us to scan and order. Save the environment (no need for paper) and also more hygienic cause you don‚Äôt need to hold the pen/pencil (need to sanitise also) found it pretty cool that a store/Kopitiam have ‚Äúonline ordering‚Äù. After you order and feel that you didn‚Äôt have enough, you can scan and order again. Simple. You can also check how much you spent easily via the website itself. Besides the self-service ordering, the sauces and the pork fats (aka oil) you are free to take by yourself. We saw button mushrooms on the menu and ordered them; for mushrooms, lovers can try grilling the mushroom. It is not bad.

Oh, yea:
- Students get discounts also on weekdays if I am not wrong it's 10%!
- Got melted cheese also for cheese lovers at an additional top-up!

I want to compliment one of the staff for helping us refill the soup automatically.

Makan Empire by Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang,Sunyi L,Had high expectations since it was Michelin. Ordered Indomie with Ayam Goreng and Nasi Lemak with Beef rendang.

Healthy.

Generous
Affordable.

These are some of the perks you get for dining with OE Salad Bar.

Their vegetables are freshly produced locally and organically. I wanted to eat healthier and a dietician told me that a variety of fruits and vegetables is CRUCIAL for maintaining good health. Much more important than just quantity. And i am glad i came across this place. They serve a huge spectrum of ingredients and this is exactly what the doctor (dietician) ordered.

Tonkotsu Kazan,Yi Ling,"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and had a great time! Portions were generous, there were fun add-ons & condiments, and the food had lots of personality!

üç≥ Free Flow Hard-Boiled Eggs
You can peel your own eggs and eat them with your ramen. I even asked the staff for some mayo and made myself a DIY egg salad with chilli flakes and sesame powder to my liking hehe.

üç∫ Sapporo Bottle Beer ‚Äì $2.90
C‚Äômon‚Ä¶ $2.90 for a cold, golden Sapporo? Can‚Äôt go wrong. Perfect pairing for ramen or karaage.

Apple Chu-Hai ‚Äì $7.00
Light, bubbly, and refreshing with a soft apple flavour. Not too boozy, just the right kind of casual drink for a laid-back dinner.

üçú Volcano Kazan Style Beef Sukiyaki Ramen ‚Äì $18.80
The star of the show. This Kazan-style ramen comes with a volcano-shaped lid that traps heat and smokes‚Äîmakes for quite the visual moment. The raw beef slices cook under the lid, and once it‚Äôs lifted, you‚Äôre left with a super rich, soy-based beefy broth.

The broth was sweet too, thanks to the generous amount of cabbage and beansprouts. Bonus: they give you a bowl of rice to enjoy with the broth afterward! You can also request raw garlic cloves to mash in, and sesame powder to tweak the flavours. So satisfying and rich!

üå∂Ô∏è LIMITED TIME: Curry Tantan Noodle ‚Äì $13.80
A thick, creamy, sesame-based broth with a strong curry aroma. Topped with spicy minced meat‚Äîit‚Äôs bold and nutty. Personally, this was a bit too heavy for me; it leaned more gravy than soup. Think: spicy Japanese tantanmen with a rich curry aroma. Definitely flavour-packed, just not for when you want something light.

üçó Chicken Nanban ‚Äì $7.80
These are crispy, tender fried chicken bites with a chunky onion-forward nanban sauce‚Äînot your usual creamy style. Great for sharing, but just a heads-up: very oniony.

ü•ü Yaki Gyoza (6pcs) ‚Äì $6.30

This is really spicy. I tried their normal spicy and this is way more spicy. I had to add more water to make it more liquid. If you can take spicy then order the ultra spicy. Noodles are nicely cooked.

Main gripe is that we wanted to order Curry Fish Head or Steamboat Fish Head ($38), but was told that both were sold out and the only fish left is the seasonal fish ($48). We got that in the end which was pretty large with much meat, just that I don‚Äôt know if the reason above is a smokescreen for us to spend more‚Ä¶

Anyway the Fingertips Chicken was amazing as the meat while tender, contained so much flavor from the spices used, so I was impressed how the chef infused the spices into the meat. The rest were decent too.

Ambience is casual and cosy. There is ample parking for everyone. Business was good considering it's location and we noticed that there were only 2 empty tables when we left.
The staff were friendly and approachable. They responded to every request, unlike some others, where the waitress do not bother to respond or were cold during peak periods. This is commendable.
The food were yummy too. The first dish is BBQ squid. It tasted great but the portion is very small. The herbal prawn soup is nice and thick. The prawns were reasonably large and fresh too. Bamboo clams were tender and chewy, and it will be the best in Singapore only if they can shorten the steaming by abit more. Finger chicken is savory and flavourful. Scallop crab meat shark fin is thick and taste great too.

Mani's Banana Leaf,Steven Lim,Karu's is our go-to restaurant regularly when we crave curry fish head. Were pleasantly surprised to chance upon this branch when we visited the venue. Decided to have an early lunch of curry fish head and white rice set. The white rice set that accompanied the curry fish head order offers free flow of vegetables and rice! Pappadum is included in the set as well. Curry fish head is just-nice spicy and comes with an aroma of flavourful spices. Remember to ask for Rasam. It is a small cup of spicy tangy drink at the end of the meal to cut through the oil and helps in digestion.

Remember to add the roasted garlic flakes into your soup for an added crunchy umami flavour.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ramen+Taisho+Hillview/@1.3954146,103.7118008,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a8e2e63938b:0xf054bb497827b7b9!8m2!3d1.3670514!4d103.7638908!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEQcmFtZW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOb2VqZFRUbU5CRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQJw!16s%2Fg%2F11cs5ss3vs"
Ramen Taisho Hillview,Victor Goh,"Great ramen fix in a place where food options are generally lacking!

The broths are rich and wholesome, collar chashu very tenderly done, belly chashu very flavorful and smoky. The DX option comes with chicken - though in a recent visit it was missing.

Personal faves are the black garlic or shio tonkotsu broths.

Been noticing a gradual decline in service though, in recent times often missing bean sprouts, and even more recently, not having their usual free flow tea anymore - they still served water, but wasn't cold!",4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ramen+Taisho+Hillview/@1.3954146,103.7118008,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a8e2e63938b:0xf054bb497827b7b9!8m2!3d1.3670514!4d103.7638908!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEQcmFtZW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOb2VqZFRUbU5CRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQJw!16s%2Fg%2F11cs5ss3vs"
Ramen Taisho Hillview,Ad K,Had their Black Garlic Ramen @ LeQuest. Surprisingly good ramen in such a hidden spot. The star is undoubtedly the soup base - thick and savory without being too oily. The noodles were firm and had bite. Chashu was small but tasty. Ajitama was well seasoned and soft in centre. I like their extras - free flow of barley tea and bean sprouts and even wet wipes.,4.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ramen+Taisho+Hillview/@1.3954146,103.7118008,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a8e2e63938b:0xf054bb497827b7b9!8m2!3d1.3670514!4d103.7638908!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEQcmFtZW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOb2VqZFRUbU5CRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQJw!16s%2Fg%2F11cs5ss3vs"
Ramen Taisho Hillview,Tasting Titan,"Had the tsukemen. Overly salty and lack of flavour from the dipping broth/sauce.

The chicken karaage is delicious! And there‚Äôs free flow beansprouts.

Ramen Taisho Hillview,Lawrence Ponsford,"I won't come here again. Lots of other better ramen options around the area. It is slightly cheaper but I don't find it worth it.

I had the 'spicy black garlic tonkotsu ramen deluxe'.
The broth was not very rich and lacked depth of flavour. The spice just tasted like heat, and didn't really enhance the dish.
The noodles were not very bouncy or chewy.
The egg was actually excellent.
The meat was ok and a reasonable quantity, but not overly tender.

If this was an $8 dish, I would have considered it better than others in the same price range. However mine was $10.80, which puts it just outside the cheap range, and I have to compare it to other more expensive ramens.

Keisuke tonkotsu king down the road, does a ramen for almost the same price, but is vastly better, and in an air conditioned restaurant, with free eggs and beansprouts.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ramen+Taisho+Hillview/@1.3954146,103.7118008,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1a8e2e63938b:0xf054bb497827b7b9!8m2!3d1.3670514!4d103.7638908!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEQcmFtZW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOb2VqZFRUbU5CRUFFqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECAAQJw!16s%2Fg%2F11cs5ss3vs"
