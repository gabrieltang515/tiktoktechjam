Meta Restaurant,Nicole Teo,"we had very high expectations for this place, which unfortunately fell short.

we really enjoyed the beef and abalone dishes, those were really well done. i also really loved their desserts - that was quite a standout. apart from these, the other courses were good but just did not really hit the spot the same way.

what left a bad impression was the rate at which food was served, it was extremely slow. we felt that the restaurant was handling more customers than it could and couldn‚Äôt keep up. also, we had to wait for awhile for a turn to use the restroom. this is a small issue, but rather unexpected.

that aside though, the service crew was really amazing and professional. they were really knowledgeable and went out of their way to serve us.

Quenino,Affinity MM,"This place is seriously underrated! I went for lunch today (weekday) and there were only three tables occupied, probably mostly guests staying at the Artyzen hotel. Maybe there are not that many people willing to pay fine dining prices for Asian fusion, or the restaurant is still under the radar in terms of publicity.
Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch - every dish was creative and thoughtfully put together. It‚Äôs the best modern Southeast Asian fusion I‚Äôve had. My favourite was the green lip abalone starter, the herbal brown butter sauce was beautifully aromatic, with a lovely charred note and not overly sweet. The yellow sauce on the yellowtail kingfish main was also fantastic, as were the various garlic based sauces served with the wagyu. Everything was so well-balanced and full of flavor. And the green chili ice cream was refreshingly unique. You can really tell that every component on each plate was crafted with care and intention by the chefs. The service was also warm and attentive, which made the whole experience more enjoyable.

TamJai SamGor Mixian Lot One,Alvin Li,"My parents go to place when they have weekdays off and want a hearty and invigorating meal.

This was going to be a food review but I'm going to talk about an Japan Hour episode.

Tam Jai decided to open in Japan. However, due to the pandemic, the HK founder was unable to fly into Japan to do a taste test to certify the quality before allowing them to open.

What's worse is that the seasoning and soup base ingredients used in HK are not easily available in Japan. There was much R&D and back and forth. Japan had to improvise and send recipes to HK for HK side to replicate to see if the broth is good enough. There were so much details, from taking order, to cooking and ingredients consequence. Watch until stressed üò•

Don't worry as there is a happy ending. If you are ever in Japan and spotted Tam Jai, be thankful that they succeeded and Japanese locals and visitors alike can enjoy the noodles.

I can say that San Suan base is my favourite even though my spice tolerance is low. I think it's their signature base because of the name.

Walk around the farm was amazing, although we visited at like 1pm so the sun was just scorching hot.

They were giving free old Pandan leaves too so we brought back a lil bunch for the smell ü§©

It was great that we couldn't hear the hustle and bustle of the busy traffic despite being situated right by the main  road. We ordered pani puri and ghee dosas along with filter coffees.

Restaurant Ibid,Georgia Leaper,"Incredible experience from Wai Leong and his team. Everything was flawless from beginning to end. We saved this as our last meal of our trip and we both said it was our favourite. A key part was that the restaurant is small enough that everything feels personalised without feeling awkward. The chefs were so knowledgable and friendly, their passion for the dishes was definitely infectious throughout the sitting. We were lucky enough to sit at the counters so we could watch the chefs and ask questions about the dishes, which were incredible and perfectly balanced for 6 courses. The food was delicious and completely different to anything else we‚Äôd eaten on our trip. The quality was unmatched!

Ayasofya Turkish Restaurant,Natasha M,"Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 5, and overall, the food was quite good.

Everyone enjoyed their meals, and the desserts were delicious‚Äînot overly sweet, which was a nice touch.

The downside was the lack of proper steak knives. We were given butter knives to cut through the steak and lamb ribs. When we asked, we were told that they had just added these dishes to the menu and were still waiting for steak knives to arrive. While understandable, it would have been better if they had waited for the knives before launching the new dishes or at least informed customers of the situation and maybe offered to assist with cutting.

Great food with Wine

No menu in homepage
Wines are quite expensive but great selections

Fish & Co.,sam Tan,"Huge disappointment today, as a customer who have been visting the restaurant since 2018, me and my friends always had enjoyed our meals and time at this restaurant. Until today, when I visitted again with my friend for dinner is our WORST eating experience by far.

It all started when we were waiting to be served, we avoided peak hours at around 4:30PM and though there were almost no customer in the restaurant, the staffs were chatting around and no one came to serve though I believe a few of them saw us. It was only until we signalled when one came over. This was still alright for us but already a bad impression. Can tell that the standards have really dropped.

Next we had our meal as per normal, UNTIL when we were about to finish. One of the staff - FAZIL, took the utensils holder straight, took the receipt which was in there and threw it disrespectfully straight at the table. We were stunned and of course unhappy by such action. If he wanted to take the utensils holder, I thought it was a basic courtesy to ask, not only did he not, he threw the receipt straight. What's worst was there were no customers even queing to be served, don't understand why it was so urgent that he had to act as such? I get much better service and respect at hawker centre and coffee shops and I DO NOT even need to pay service charges. I am paying service charges for such service WOW. And guess what? That is not it, he later came back again and took away my glass when my drink was still HALF FILLED. We may have finished our food but does that mean we won't want our drinks anymore? Hello? We paid for the drinks too!

Seems like only prices increase while service decreased SO MUCH. Congrats! You have just lost yourself a group of loyal customers who visit on a constant basis. We may or may not be the first who was dissapointed by such service but if it does not improve and if FAZIL is still serving, there would only be more. Seriously WORST experience ever, I would reccomend my friends and family to avoid visiting this restaurant again and I would NEVER step food into any branch of this restaurant anymore.",1.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fish+%26+Co./@1.3394886,103.6691575,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da0feccd71a5db:0xd320a963b69936d5!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da0f932c000001:0xe3fd23f209e71fbc!8m2!3d1.3399257!4d103.7062886!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgESc2VhZm9vZF9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJrZDB4TFNVMW5FQUWqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABBD!16s%2Fg%2F11gbv26h58"

The Happy Cafe,Ratinah Rawi,"Had a late lunch with my hubby at Gain City, Happy Cafe in in Sungei Kadut.

Halal certified.

I ordered the fish and chips, which came with generous, chunky wedges topped with cheese‚Äîvery tasty! The fish was fresh, though I would have preferred the batter to be a bit crispier. The spicy chili sauce really added a nice kick.

I also had the icy strawberry mint drink, which was super refreshing‚Äîperfect for the hot day.

The only downside was that the air conditioning could only really be felt when the exit doors were closed.

Still, overall, I really enjoyed my meal and the experience. Looking forward to coming back again... and getting my new fan fixed next week! ü§ó

Tsukimi Hamburg,Sim Simon,"As evidenced by the shop's wall pics, the restaurant's trade-mark artwork prominently highlights a raw chicken-egg (resembling a full moon) atop a hamburger patty, hence its name ""moon viewing"". Indeed, a very unique and romantic concept!
We ordered 3 signature sets:
*foie gras
*mushroom (kinoko), and
*avocado.
The meat patty was scrumptious and tender to the bite. The tamago (egg) soup was also delightful (not too salty).
(We, as laymen, are puzzled why the industry continues to use the word ""steak"" for the patty.)
The pricing of the menu items was ""pocket-friendly"".

Shoutout to the shokupan because it was umami-ing.
The crab mafaldine? You can take my card and my bank account and all my assets. The sauce coating the pasta was very lovely. I am 90% sure that the crab stock was boiled for 73 years and 2 months, causing a very rich bold crab flavour but not overpowering. Cucumbers in a pasta? Weird when you read it but it actually pairs so well as it gives a little bit of freshness in every bite, making you feel like eating 1 portion is not enough.

Restaurant is located in vibrant Keong Saik

We were welcomed by friendly staff who made sure to provide a great service.
Food was simply amazing; starting by an authentic Pissaladi√®re and fresh Burrata to start.

Mains were delicious too; Monkfish tail has a generous serving and is paired with a tasty Chorizo and Ratatouille side. Pastis flamb√©ed Tiger Prawns are generous and divine. Bouillabaisse is served with Rouille sauce exactly like in France.

Desserts were the star of the show Deconstructed Lemon & Meringue pie is well balanced and tasty. Pistachio cr√®me br√ªl√©e is very original and delicious. Strawberry millefeuille is a classic that never disappoint and my dad was thrilled by the Molten cookie with salted caramel sauce.

Milan Shokudo,Shanice Teo,"The food was alright especially if you are looking for something cheap but good. The only problem I had was the staffs there, particularly the staff that has blue hair. She was very rude when me and my friends when we simply asked her nicely if its possible to add on and pay extra to our order due to us clicking wrongly but she answered rudely and said it wasn‚Äôt possible and we were totally okay with that response as we wanted clarification. What I don‚Äôt understand is why does she have to reply to us like that as if we pissed her off when we weren‚Äôt even shouting or yelling at her? From there we lost our appetite. To add on, she was talking very loudly and rudely to her coworkers on how tired she is to ‚Äòentertain‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt know what that means but okay. And then she was yelling loudly again that she is tired and pissed and while saying that, she threw the menu. Maybe she had a bad day or that she faced too many customers that pissed her off, I understand that. But that doesn‚Äôt mean she got to shout and yell emphasising shes tired to entertain people. If she is tired then simply quit the job as an fnb staff and find another job, is that easy. Everyone is working as well but I am pretty sure that they are not complaining out loud especially if they want to earn money.

WellSmoocht,Hayley,"This place has become one of my favorite vegan restaurants in Singapore!

Great variety of choices from salads, wraps, burgers, bowls, pizzas, desserts and healthy drinks. Price is reasonable and most of all, the foods are just delicious that we always end up with ordering too muchü§§

If you are looking for something special, try the Truffle Cheeseburger Pizza. It's not a burger (of course!) but you'll be amazed by the nice combination of marinated tempeh, cashew cheese and vegetables.

As for wraps, we've tried the Eggxellent Avo Wrap and Temphetion (Sh)room Wrap. Personally I like the Eggxellent better and the tofu does taste like eggs. By the way the seaweed fries come with the wraps are ridiculously delicious that I even asked if I can order extra (unfortunately not). Hope one day can see them in the menuüôè

There are (too) many options for desserts but finally we chose PB & J Brownie Mudpie. Unlike most of the brownies that have thick/creamy texture, the Mudpie here is more like eating strawberry ice cream in a chocolate tart. The texture is so light that you can finish it in secondsü§£

Paradise Dynasty Ê®ÇÂ§©ÁöáÊúù at Westgate,Ming Shen Tham,"Paradise Dynasty is a popular spot, especially during dinner hours, so it‚Äôs best to make a reservation in advance if you don‚Äôt want to wait.

Food-wise, it‚Äôs generally consistent, though I personally find their noodle dishes to be more reliable than the stir-fry options. My go-to is the dry spicy noodles with pork and prawn dumpling‚Äîit's flavourful without being overly spicy, and always hits the spot.

Their stir-fry dishes can be hit-or-miss. For example, the spinach stir-fry can be well-seasoned on some days but completely bland on others. The stir-fried beef also suffers from this inconsistency.

Appetiser-wise, the black fungus with peppercorn and garlic used to be a favourite, but they seem to have reduced the quality recently, making it tougher to chew. On the other hand, the cucumber with garlic, chilli and vinegar is refreshing and appetising, and the drunken chicken remains flavourful and well-marinated.

Rangooli Restaurant @ Clementi,Anikaz Travel,"Wanderlust place for Indian food. I really enjoyed the naan and Gobi Manchurian. They were amazingly crisp and delicious. They had a slight crunch to it. Along with that, they were perfectly seasoned. For the naan I opted for a naan basket which consisted of cheese naan, garlic naan and butter naan. I was astonished by the size of the servings. They were huge portions.
The paneer that accompanied the naan was actually quite sweet. So if you want a spicier version of paneer butter masala I think you should inform them.
The mushroom mutter curry was extremely flavourful and contained various spices.
The staff was amazing. She could memories all our orders profeciently even in the hectic and chaotic environment!

PUTIEN,Stella Tan,"Have always been a PUTIEN fan but gotta give them only 4 stars this time round as we felt the standards have dropped slightly. The drunken cockles are 10/10 as always, a perfect little snack to kickstart the meat and whet your appetite. Tangy, spicy, garlicky‚Ä¶ just so good.

Their yellow croaker dishes are so highly raved but we were just disappointed. The fish meat turned out tender but honestly there‚Äôs not much‚Ä¶. Taste. Not worth the hype and as a personal preference, yellow croaker just has too many fine bones and such a hassle to eat.

Salmaan Food Paradise,Sheryl Lee,"Used to dine here quite often, about 6-7 years back. We usually have our dinner here, or do the occasional takeaway. There were a few turn-offs that made us rather choose other dining options. Until recently, we decided to give them a try again as we didn't have much time for a meal. Their prices are unreasonably high, the taste & appearance of their food differs every visit (inconsistent), their utensils are not the cleanest, and the indoor seats & tables have this ''oily'' feeling that makes you uncomfortable when you sit there. Though this has changed, fast forward to 2024/2025, they have upgraded their seats, so it's not as bad anymore. However the inconsistency of their food remains, and the unreasonable prices continue to exist.
We had our dinner there recently (Feb 2025), and their maggie goreng with chicken costs $6, I was shocked when I found out about the price. I mean I'm aware of inflation and all that stuff, but to be very honest $6 sounds a little absurd. Furthermore, this area is pretty secluded, as compared to e.g. other similar stores that are near shopping malls, etc, and given the location, shouldn't the price be more affordable? I believe only the residents here as well as maybe people working at the polyclinic nearby are aware of this store. When we dined here often many years back, we used to order an item that was not on the menu, and they simply charged us at an unreasonable price, the cooking was again, inconsistent.
Another thing that I would like to add on, is that the owner of the store, when we were settling the bill, actually said to our faces that it's been a long time since we last dined here, and that we usually go to the other store in that area. Not knowing what to reply, we simply brushed it off. Their pratas used to be so bad, they had many burnt parts, but this previous visit it was actually not like that anymore. The inconsistency is still there, as one of the weekdays we went there for dinner, and we ordered the maggie goreng with chicken, was actually not bad (though it made us thirsty lol, so probably MSG or something like that) and the very next day we went there for lunch, but guess what, the noodles were wetter this time round. It tasted different from the one we had the evening before.
Please, do something about the hygiene levels at this place, as in this latest visit, I have literally seen with my own eyes, this uncle who only finished half of his plate of food, and he slowly pushed the leftovers on the plate to the other end of the table, just so the mynahs that were hanging around could eat it. One mynah walked over towards the plate, and was looking at the uncle while approaching it, and proceeded to grab a mouthful of food, before skipping away. There seems to be bird waste on the table as well. Flocks of pigeons can be seen hanging around the entrance of the store at any time of the day, and sometimes they even enter the store while there are customers eating there.",2.0,negative,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Salmaan+Food+Paradise/@1.3452268,103.6952284,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1020d1a13d83:0x2ffca27cf81235a4!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da1020d174bbf1:0x6a9c33fc41d25710!8m2!3d1.3502561!4d103.7312915!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERaW5kaWFuX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVUXRjVWwyWW5GQlJSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABA1!16s%2Fg%2F11f12662pd"

Blu Kouzina Dempsey,Alan Tang,"Early birthday celebration for our eldest son.

Enjoyed the very friendly services of Blu Kouzina Dempsey from the moment we stepped in the restaurant. All the staff ensured we were comfortable and offered us recommendations of their signature dishes.

We must say that the food were very good. The Horiatiki Salad was refreshing and serving was huge (even though we ordered only the small portion).

The pita and dips were superb, we enjoyed the humus, cod roe and eggplant dips thoroughly. So much so we wanted to order another portion of pita but the wonderful attendant suggested we held on to our order as it might be too much for us after the meat dishes.

Indeed so. After the grilled octopus and meat platter arrived, we would definitely not be able to finish the additional order of pita. And the small grilled meat serving of lamb chops, meatball, chicken and beef were rather big portion. Meat were well grilled and tasted great.

The grilled octopus was really nice, throughout our meals, we were trying to figure out how the chef could grill the octopus into such crisp and yet tender bites. No wonder the dish had been their ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù.

Fortunately our order of Baklava wasn‚Äôt  that huge as we had eaten in Turkey. But the individual piece size was just right. And not that sweet as we anticipated. The flavor of coconut and nut filling suited our taste buds. They were delicious. Of course, this cannot be consumed often (due to high sugar content - my glucose level shot up after I took just one).

Knowing that we were celebrating Alexander‚Äôs birthday, the staff arranged a complimentary cake and fruit platter for him. They even offered us complimentary shots of red sweet wine but we didn‚Äôt accept as we were non drinkers. So thoughtful of them. Thank youüôèüèª.

It was a memorable evening.

Good Bites,Sion Toh,"Ordered the fish and chip, Passion fruit sparkling Americano and chocolate lava cake.

The fish and chip consist 2 pieces of battered fish, thin fries and salad. The fish is soft and fresh which tasted great, the fries is crispy and the salad is fresh. The batter is a bit too thick and a bit too greasy, if the batter can be a bit thinner it'll be more crispy and probably feel a bit less greasy.

The passion fruit sparkling Americano is surprisingly good, I have never tried sparkling coffee before and this drink blends surprisingly well.

The lava cake tasted great too. The cake is soft and has a very strong chocolatey taste. Would have been better if it's a bit bigger. You can also choose the flavor of ice cream that comes with it.

Hideaway by Semura Bistro,Larry Chu,"Tried this restaurant for its much raved about beef steak in many ways, of which the most interesting about this place is its 1000deg C Salamander Broiler which does the searing of its steaks.

I ordered this 800g Peter Luger style ribeye. My verdict for this steak that cost me $120.

1. The doneness was towards medium to medium well, although I was not asked how should my steak be done during ordering
2. The searing was absolutely good. Crusty, smoky sear, impressed by the machine. It's no doubt a good sear for a steak of about 2inches!
3. Could have been more generous in its seasoning. Lack of seasoning makes the overall experience lacking.
4. The steak, though its a prime ribeye Cut was way too tough for my teeth work.. For this price, I would have expected a better cut of rib eye with better marbling.

Overall, a lacklustre experience despite so much recommendations about its steak. I believe it could have been better if the chef focus on the total experience of customers eating this steak instead of just the hype of its searing with a 1000 deg C broiler.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hideaway+by+Semura+Bistro/@1.3071212,103.7640697,14z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da10af89f2fec9:0xa7cbdd0f75b6b864!8m2!3d1.3345554!4d103.8099324!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEGYmlzdHJvmgFEQ2k5RFFVbFJRVU52WkVOb2RIbGpSamx2VDJwQ1QxSkVSalZXUjBaUlZEQmFNV0pWVWtSTVYwWlhVekZvU0ZRd1JSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIABAv!16s%2Fg%2F11fy98fy72"

Red Lantern Restaurant (Bukit Batok),Esmond Chun,"Found this restaurant from Google map and the review seem good.
The restaurant is located right inside of the HDB block, need some distance to walk from the main road.
We have ordered few of their popular dishes like curry fish head, cai pu beancurd,  beancurd pork ribs with red wine and dried shrimp french bean. We like their curry fishhead as the spice is strong, provide reasonable of vegetables and served when it hot. The fish meat tasted ""fresh"" and just nice for my 2 bowl of rice üòÖ. As for the cai pu beancurd, I find it is something different in preparing but tasted not very special except the fried cai pu. As for the pork ribs, the surface fried/cooked to crispy and if sauce can be more sweet will be better. French bean will not fantastic but if they can cook the bean more crispy will be great.

Summer Palace,Leong Hana,"We had a lovely time at this restaurant. Their service was impeccable right from the start, when I asked to see the menu. Their manager, Sydney was v friendly n helpful in introducing the food that I was looking for. Their prices for similar food are higher than my usual haunt, Hai Tian Lou, by $10-12 per dish with slightly larger portions. The service n atmosphere makes up the difference too.
All service staff wore a smile n were quick to come forward to help in every little way. Thou, we order 2 dishes only, as we had dim sum tea jus before 5pm, our server, Alwin is v happy to introduce their range of ""caffeine free"" tea to help digest our ""dim sum"".
The crabmeat in our fried rice is juicy n fresher than what we had before, in a generous amount.
Sydney brought us samples of 2 other dishes and the Har Cheong pork belly is the best!

Revisited this fine dinner restaurant within 2 months, this time happened to enjoy their 2yr anniversary promotion, 6 oysters for only 12 dollars, and if come for lunch, 200g beef steak only for 20 SGD... Super deal, thus right away make the reservation with their staff, Joyce for next visit on the coming Sunday, part of the reason is Joyce is super friendly and helpful, patient to our questions
.. recommended and you will live this restaurant like we do.

I like this fine-dinning restaurant located in downtown area near Raffles hotel, who is serving western style dishes

Z√©n,Catherine Tan,"This is a late review from our visit to Z√©n in September 2024.

The neo-Nordic cuisine had its highlights, and my favourite dish of the evening was the chawanmushi with caviar - delicate, comforting, and luxurious. Some dishes leaned towards tartness, likely due to fermentation and preservation techniques, which is characteristic of this style.

We had different beverage pairings - mixed, alcoholic, and non-alcoholic. I had the non-alcoholic pairing, and most of the drinks were quite sour, with only one exception. The dessert, Amelia tomato, coconut, passion fruit sorbet, was meant to be a palate cleanser but was extremely sour.

The staff were engaging and friendly, making small talk while preparing dishes in front of us, which added a warm, personal touch to the evening.

To me, good set menus tell me what I want to get a la carte the next time. Great set menus are ones where I want to come back and get the set menu again. This falls under the former to me. There just isn't anything novel or unique enough, and the experience not challenging enough to do it again.

Al-Azhar Restaurant,I W,"Al-Azhar Restaurant really needs no introduction.  It is a famous eatery that is well patronised by people from all walks of life.  Indeed, customers seem to be streaming in throughout the day and well into the night, to the wee hours of the next day.

There are so many food options - there's literally something for everyone here.  You might be overwhelmed with the vast array of choices that you have.  After you have, after careful consideration, decided what to eat, the same overwhelming choices presents itself again when you decide what to drink.

We ordered the Sizzling Rib Eye Steak ($22.90), Mutton Satay, Mutton Malasa Prata Set, and Seafood Sambal Kway Teow.

Some people like to be given options - the more the merrier.  A stall offering 100 dishes is better than a stall offering only 10 dishes, in their opinion.  Nothing wrong with that.

But as a foodie, I'd prefer to patronise a stall that specialises in one or two dishes.  That stall will sink or swim just on those dishes alone.  The stall has every incentive to ensure its own survival by mastering and serving the best possible dish, and not be a jack of all trades but master of none.

Al-Azhar serves some good stuff (prata for example), and some of its food could be quite good, provided you do not compare it to the competition. For example, their Mutton Satay is quite nice, but there were a couple of sticks of Satay that were difficult to chew because they used Mutton meat containing tendon.  Compare this with a satay specialist stall, Al-Azhar's Satay will be blown out of the water.

Bottom line:  Al-Azhar's food is nice, but not great.",3.0,neutral,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Al-Azhar+Restaurant/@1.3697086,103.7305602,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!3m6!1s0x31da1061d6232917:0xe6d49d41daf444e7!8m2!3d1.3425021!4d103.7753333!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgEYaW5kaWFuX211c2xpbV9yZXN0YXVyYW50mgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJ3T0U5aU1tdFJSUkFCqgFREAEqDyILcmVzdGF1cmFudHMoADIeEAEiGrKDpIbpSRVtZQ6N1D1wcAyxL3Ex0RdrLPrbMhwQAiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3Jl4AEA-gEECCsQSg!16s%2Fg%2F1th0vwh0"

Fish & Co.,Ying Yi ONG,"I'm not sure how their operations work. Staff in dark grey shirt left me waiting and barely acknowledged me when I raised my hand to order. I could wait for him to clear the plates. But he then walked past me to the entrance to let more guests come in afterwards, then took some time to attend to those guests after they were seated. Then proceeds to clear other tables. Did he forget? As I was searching for another staff, there was indeed another staff available (yellow shirt) but then went to attend to table right beside me who rose their hands. I raised my hand to him while he walked over, but he simply ignored me throughout the time he walked back and forth to the table next to me. What I did: After noticing I was simply ignored by everyone, I straight up went to the initial staff and asked, ""Can I order?"", then he comes and follow me back at my table. I also feedback that I raised my hands so many times. But there was no reaction, it feels dismissive.

Maybe each staff has their own ""area"" to attend to? But there could be more focus on communcating with the customers about it? It left me feeling like each customer is treated differently.

Zaffron Tandoori - North Indian and Mexican Restaurant & Bar,navid ghannad,"Zaffron Tandoori at Boat Quay turned out to be a great dinner spot, especially for those who enjoy classic North Indian food in a scenic setting. We were seated right by the river, with a full view of the skyline across the water, and that alone set the tone for a relaxed evening. The place fills up fast, but we got a good table and the location really adds to the experience.

We ordered a range of dishes: Zafrani Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Chicken Masala, a Naan basket, and rice. The food came out nicely presented and looked exactly like what you‚Äôd hope for from a proper tandoori place. The chicken tikka was tender with just the right amount of char, and the butter chicken had a smooth, creamy sauce with a mild heat. The Chicken Masala packed more spice and depth, which balanced out the rest of the meal. The naan was fresh, fluffy, and hot‚Äîclearly made on order, and definitely one of the better naan baskets we‚Äôve had in Singapore.

Drinks included a happy hour beer mug, a glass of Ashi wine, and a couple of regular and diet cokes. Not a huge drinks list, but decent enough. The service was polite and relatively quick.

The food felt generous for a group of four, and the total came to 133 SGD including service charge. For the location and view, I think that‚Äôs fair. You‚Äôre paying a little extra for the setting, but it‚Äôs not tourist trap pricing either.

It‚Äôs worth noting that the vibe here is very casual. Tables are close together, and the menu is on display outside like at a street restaurant. That said, the food quality is surprisingly consistent with what you‚Äôd expect from a more formal setting. A lot of locals and tourists alike seemed to be enjoying their evening.

Would definitely recommend if you're craving North Indian food while in Singapore, and want to sit outdoors by the water.

Each meal starts with a complimentary tiny ice cream cone made of seaweed, yuzu gel, and minced fish, a delightful and refreshing amuse-bouche.

The first course was Himeji fish with a bonito reduction and buttermilk. The fish was incredibly fresh and clean-tasting, perfectly elevated by the sauces and sides.

Next came what Rhubarb is famous for‚Äîemulsions. We were served a celeriac root emulsion with a black truffle base, pickled shimeji mushrooms, and dusted with beetroot powder. This dish was a revelation, with the truffle notes, acidity from the shimeji, and the creamy celeriac emulsion creating a rave party in my mouth.

The main course was quail with cauliflower pur√©e, a charcoal waffle, and pomegranate sauce. The quail was juicy and tender, and when eaten with the various components, it offered a symphony of flavours and textures. The head chef personally came out to serve and explain the dish, adding a special touch to the experience.

Dessert was a creative banana masterpiece, featuring a jelly layer made of banana skin and vanilla, resting on coconut sorbet, honeycomb, and banana slices. It was a perfect end to the meal.

I had mentioned it was my partner's birthday during the reservation, and Rhubarb went above and beyond. They prepared a chocolate cake and a ""dessert drawer"" filled with various sweet treats, adding an extra layer of joy to our celebration.",5.0,positive,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Encore+by+Rhubarb/@1.305512,103.6858988,12z/data=!4m11!1m3!2m2!1sRestaurants+in+Singapore!6e5!3m6!1s0x31da196d66892a49:0xa556409c36f74a38!8m2!3d1.2793726!4d103.8430536!15sChhSZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBTaW5nYXBvcmVaGiIYcmVzdGF1cmFudHMgaW4gc2luZ2Fwb3JlkgERZnJlbmNoX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnSaASRDaGREU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTnVhRjlFU0c1M1JSQUKqAVEQASoPIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50cygAMh4QASIasoOkhulJFW1lDo3UPXBwDLEvcTHRF2ss-tsyHBACIhhyZXN0YXVyYW50cyBpbiBzaW5nYXBvcmXgAQD6AQQIHxBG!16s%2Fg%2F11dymd6zhx"

Bistro by Gardenasia,Haze Feng,"This bistro is a nice option around the area after we visited the Hay Dairies Farm. There were several parking lots available so it was quite convenient for people who drive but there wasn't any bus stop outside so not sure if this bistro is really catered for the public or just the farm stay place.

I appreciate that the staff were friendly, polite and prompt. Food was generally good, slightly disappointed for the Char-Grilled Ribeye Hor Fun as it is not anything special which I was initially anticipating it to be because of the price. We also ordered the Crispy Prata Puffs and felt it was too oily and taste-less, although I really appreciate that the staff highlighted to me that it doesn't come with any sauce.

CANCHITA - Peruvian Cuisine,Chinese Moon,"Amazing food, especially the Ceviche which is the best I've tasted in Singapore. The tuna tostada was also tasty and balanced.  The duck taco had a weird taste as they put pineapple salsa.  Gives it a plastic taste, so order only if you like this combination of duck and pineapple.  The prawn omelette was very tasty but felt overwhelming with strong flavours in the egg (probably milk and butter) and strong flavour in the prawns with adobo sauce.

Nouri,Elaine Neo (Ê¢ÅÈõÅÂ©∑),"If you‚Äôre looking for a fine meal, you‚Äôll find many places in üá∏üá¨. But if you‚Äôre looking to have a memorable experience, to feel, think, and reimagine through delicious food that surprises you, then you‚Äôll find yourself at Nouri - the older sister of Appetite (where we visited a couple times now.)

Crossroads cooking is the ethos at Nouri, rooted in the belief that cultures do not exist in isolation, and neither should food. It‚Äôs an idea born not just of creativity, but of research, anthropology, and compassion. Behind each dish is a long process of inquiry, sourcing, and deep listening. Chef Ivan and his team approach food as part anthropology, part philosophy, and part art, translating centuries of migration, memory, and meaning into dishes

It‚Äôs rare for every single dish in a tasting menu to be on point. Nouri did that well - some dishes hit harder than expected, both in flavour and feeling. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve come close to tearing up during a meal, in the best possible way. ü•π Each dish seemingly asks: ‚ÄúWhat does this mean in your culture? What does this mean in mine?‚Äù The meal never feels intellectual for the sake of it. Instead, it feels intimate, like someone has mapped the world and found a way to serve it to you.

Special shoutout to Dominique for the book recommendations and Wyman who takes hospitality to the next level - I‚Äôve never met such an attentive and curious host!
