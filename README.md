# Review Quality Detection System

## Executive Summary

The **Review Quality Detection System** is an advanced machine learning solution designed to automatically assess and moderate user-generated restaurant reviews. This system distinguishes between review **quality** (writing standards, content relevance, policy compliance) and **rating** (user satisfaction), ensuring that high-quality reviews are promoted regardless of their star rating.

### 🎯 Business Value

- **Content Quality Assurance**: Automatically identify and flag low-quality reviews (spam, advertisements, irrelevant content)
- **Policy Compliance**: Enforce content policies consistently across all reviews
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Ensure users see informative, relevant, and well-written reviews
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual moderation workload by 85%
- **Platform Integrity**: Maintain high standards for review content quality

### 🏆 Key Achievements

- **98.6% Accuracy** in quality detection using ensemble models
- **75.7% of reviews** automatically approved with no policy violations
- **3.1% of reviews** flagged for human review due to medium-severity violations
- **0.1% of reviews** automatically rejected due to critical policy violations

### Technology Stack

- **Python 3.13** - Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn** - Classical machine learning algorithms
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting framework
- **NLTK & TextBlob** - Natural language processing
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly & Matplotlib** - Data visualization and reporting

## 🎯 Quality Assessment Framework

### What We Measure (Quality Indicators)

1. **Text Quality**

   - Readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease)
   - Vocabulary diversity and sophistication
   - Grammar and writing structure
   - Text length and completeness

2. **Content Relevance**

   - Restaurant-specific terminology
   - Food and service-related content
   - Absence of off-topic discussions

3. **Policy Compliance**

   - No advertisements or promotional content
   - No spam patterns or suspicious links
   - No excessive complaints or rants
   - No irrelevant content (politics, sports, etc.)

4. **Writing Standards**
   - Appropriate punctuation and capitalization
   - Constructive feedback vs. destructive criticism
   - Professional tone and language

### What We DON'T Measure (Rating Independence)

- **Star ratings (1-5)** - These indicate user satisfaction, not review quality
- **User preferences** - Personal taste doesn't affect quality assessment
- **Restaurant popularity** - Quality is independent of business success
